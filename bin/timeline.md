## Update History:
- v1.23-1.24: Added a handful of key historical events, such as Edward Tauss the head of CIA UFO disinformation in the 50's
- v1.22: Fixing the date of Dr. Eric W. Davis's March, 2020 classified briefing to the Senate (I had it listed as March 2019) - info from NY Times. Basic locations added to Eberhart records using OpenAI.
- v1.20: Split up into 5 parts, to work around iPhone web browser limits. Minor spelling and grammer fixes throughout timeline.
- v1.15: Eberhart records now have basic locations, thanks to OpenAI's Davinci-3 AI model. They aren't perfect, but it's a good start to geocoding them.
- v1.14: Added nuclear test data, over 2000 records, from the [Worldwide Nuclear Explosions](https://web.archive.org/web/20220407121213/https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/my_papers/WW_nuclear_tests_IASPEI_HB.pdf) paper by Yang, North, Romney, and Richards. Note the locations in the paper are approximate, and the yields are not super accurate, which are two problems I'll fix over time. I improved the coordinates of the earliest USA/USSR tests by looking them up from Wikipedia.
- v1.13: Split up the timeline into 4 parts. Still not the best solution, but it avoids croaking browsers.
- v1.12: Added \*U\* database record data, using a custom event description decoder to handle his 1k+ abbreviations and custom syntax
- v1.11: Crawled all ~10.5k unique URL's in this timeline using [curl](https://curl.se/) and fixed dead URL's to use archive.org.
- v1.10: Added NIPCAP DB data.

## Important Notes:
Best viewed on a desktop/laptop, not a mobile device.

I've split up the timeline into 4 parts, to reduce their sizes: distant past up to 1949, 1950-1959, 1960-1979, and 1980-present.

The majority of the events in this chronology are sighting related, however it's important to be aware that this is a timeline of 
UFO/UAP related _events_, not necessarily or exclusively UFO _sightings_. 

Some sighting reports or events appear multiple times in this timeline because they appear in more than one data source. I view this as a useful feature.

Currently, the events are not sorted by time of day, only by date. Some sources have separate "time" fields, but most don't. This will be fixed once the event times are automatically extracted from the description fields.

A few events don't have firm dates, for example "Summer of 1947", or "Late July 1952". In these instances the compilation code uses fixed dates I selected for date sorting purposes. (See the code for the specific dates.)

## Source Code:
This website is created automatically using a [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) command line tool called “ufojson”. It parses the raw text and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) source data to [JSON format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), which is then converted to a single large web page using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). This tool's source code and all of the raw source and JSON data is located [here on github](https://github.com/richgel999/ufo_data).

### <a name="5AA87AC1">Event 2 (5AA87AC1)</a>
**Date:** 812  
**Locations:** Lyon, France; Magonia; Mahón, the port of the island of Menorca, Spain  
**Description:** [Agobard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agobard)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agobard) the archbishop of Lyon, France, writes De Grandine et Tonitruis \(“On Hail and Thunder”\), in which he condemns pagan folk beliefs, such as the notion of a “certain region called Magonia, from which ships, navigating on clouds, set sail to transport back to this same region the fruits of the earth ruined by hail and destroyed by the storm.” He cites an episode in which some foolish peasants capture “three men and one woman who they said had fallen from these ships.” Brought out in front of an enraged mob, Agobard intervenes and prevents their lynching, persuading the crowd that the charges are false and absurd. Some ufologists interpret this as a visitation from an alternate reality or an abduction case, while Jean-Louis Brodu observes that in the 9th century the atmosphere was likened to an ocean in which aerial ships could navigate from point to point on the earth. Miceal Ross argues that Magonia is a corruption of Magonianus, relating to the city of Mahón, the port of the island of Menorca, Spain.

### <a name="9EC8C3DD">Event 32 (9EC8C3DD)</a>
**Date:** 4/4/1561  
**Location:** Nuremberg, Germany  
**Description:** Dusk. A “frightening vision” is seen in the sky above Nuremberg, Germany, said to be observed by many. Printer [Hans Glaser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans%5FGlaser) describes in his broadside many blood-red, blue, and black balls or discs near the Sun. “They were three alongside each other, sometimes four in a square, and several alone, and between these balls blood- colored crosses” are seen. Two “great pipes” \(cannon\) are also observed, and everything starts to “fight against each other.” The battle lasts about one hour, then the burning balls fall to the earth and vanish on the ground. Although cited as a possible early UFO report, the narrative is simply about a battle in the sky by phantom armies told as an allegory of what awaits an unrepentant humanity on Judgment Day.

**Date:** 8/15/1663  
**Locations:** church in a village near Lake Zarobozero, Vologda Oblast, Russia; Lake Zarobozero, Vologda Oblast, Russia  
**Description:** 12:00 noon. The faithful gathered in a church in a village near Lake Zarobozero, Vologda Oblast, Russia, hear a loud noise outside and see a large ball of fire descend from the north and then head south following the lake, low over its surface. The fireball seems to measure about 140 feet across and has blue smoke issuing from its sides. Two fiery rays extend from its front part. Less than an hour later, a similar fireball reappears over the same lake. Moving from south to west, the object again disappears. It reappears a third time a short while later, this time larger than before, and stays over the lake for an hour and a half. Peasants in a boat try to get close to it, but the heat is too intense. The water of the lake is illuminated to a depth of 30 feet, and fish are seen swimming away from the object, which then flies off to the west.

**Description:** 5:00 p.m. Physician [Thomas Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%5FShort%5F%28physician%29) witnesses a blood-red luminous display in the sky around Sheffield, England, which moves from west to north and then to the east. The cause seems to be one or more clouds in which are embedded brilliant lights as bright as the full moon that give off slow-moving streamers or rays.

**Description:** Dawn. Parson-naturalist [Gilbert White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%5FWhite) wakes up at his vicarage in Selborne, Hampshire, England, and finds the neighboring clover fields matted all over with a thick coat of cobwebs, laced with dew. The dogs are blinded by it when they attempt to hunt. At 9:00 a.m. more cobwebs fall from the sky and continue until dusk. They are “perfect flakes or rags; some near an inch broad, and five or six long, which fell with a degree of velocity that showed they were considerably heavier than the atmosphere.” The fall extends to the neighboring villages of New Alresford and Bradley.

When it reaches 20° against the sky, it takes a horizontal path with an undulating motion before disappearing in the northeast after a full 30 seconds. The front part is luminous with a frame-like structure behind it, and it has a faint trail. The date is questionable since Mortimer calls this a “Thursday” and December 16 was a Sunday.

**Locations:** Lausanne, Switzerland; Solothurn, Switzerland; Paris, France  
**Description:** 12:00 noon. An amateur astronomer named de Rostan is observing the Sun at Lausanne, Switzerland, when he notices a large, spindle-shaped body moving across the solar disc from east to west at a slower rate of speed than sunspots move. It is surrounded by a thin “nebulosity.” An observer named Croste in Solothurn, Switzerland, also observes the object, but French astronomer [Charles Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FMessier), who is also taking solar measurements in Paris, France, does not see it. It remains visible until September 7, when it passes the Sun’s western limb.

He sees them through an achromatic refractor at the naval observatory located in the Hôtel de Cluny in Paris, France. His estimate of their size \(one-600th the size of the solar disc\) puts them near the limit of resolution for his telescope, but Messier claims the objects are far away and in focus.

**Date:** 1783  
**Location:** Bath, England  
**Description:** British astronomer [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FHerschel) has been observing the lunar surface since the mid-1770s in Bath, England, and writes journal entries in which he details sightings of immense trees, forests, and pastures, comparing it to the English countryside. By 1778, he is seeing circular formations that he thinks are towns and villages. He also notes canals, roads, and patches of vegetation, but never writes about it publicly, since he knows that telescopic observations can be tricky.

**Date:** 8/18/1783  
**Locations:** British Isles; North Sea; east coast of Scotland; England; English Channel; southwestern France; northern Italy; Windsor Castle, Berkshire, England  
**Description:** 9:15–9:30 p.m. An unusually bright bolide is observed in the British Isles on a clear, dry night. Analysis indicates that the meteor has entered the Earth’s atmosphere over the North Sea, before passing over the east coast of Scotland, England, and the English Channel; it finally breaks up, after a passage within the atmosphere of around 1,000 miles, over southwestern France or northern Italy. Perhaps the most prominent witness is [Tiberius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius%5FCavallo) [Cavallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius%5FCavallo)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius%5FCavallo) an Italian natural philosopher who happens to be among a group of people on the terrace at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, England, at the time the meteor appears.

### <a name="9A5230B6">Event 91 (9A5230B6)</a>
**Date:** 6/12/1790  
**Location:** Alençon, Normandy, France  
**Description:** 5:00 a.m. Several farmers in Alençon, Normandy, France, see a large globe surrounded by flames and making a whistling sound. The object slows, oscillates, and moves toward the top of a hill, unearthing some plants along the slope. The heat is so intense that grass and small trees start burning. In the evening the sphere is still warm. Witnesses include two mayors, a doctor, and three other authorities in addition to the dozens of peasants who are present. A kind of door opens and a person emerges. He is dressed in a tight-fitting suit and, seeing all the people, says some words that are not understood. He runs into the woods. The sphere explodes silently, throwing pieces everywhere, and these pieces burn until they are powder. The original source is allegedly from a June 17 report by a Police Inspector Liabeuf and forwarded to the French Academy of Sciences. However, the Academy reported in 2006 that it has no knowledge of such a report in its archives. Probable hoax.

**Date:** 2/22/1803  
**Alternate date:** 3/24/1803  
**Location:** Hitachi province, Japan  
**Description:** An attractive young woman aged 18–20 years old arrives on a beach aboard a “hollow ship” \(Utsuro-bune\) that looks like a rice cooking pot or incense burner in Hitachi province, Japan. Fishermen bring her inland to investigate further, but the woman is unable to communicate in Japanese. She is dressed in a foreign fashion made of unknown fabrics and is clutching an ornate box also marked with the unknown script. The vessel is covered in hieroglyphs that no one can decipher. The fishermen return her and her vessel to the sea, where it drifts away. Accounts of the tale appear in three texts: Toen shōsetsu \(1825\), Hyōryū kishū \(1835\), and Ume-no-chiri \(1844\), but no official records mention it.

**Date:** 5/16/1808  
**Locations:** Biskopsberga; Skänninge; Sweden  
**Description:** 4:00 p.m. Swedish lichenologist [Erik Acharius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik%5FAcharius) watches a stream of dark-brown spherical objects moving slowly through the sky in a straight line over Biskopsberga, near Skänninge, Sweden. Some hover temporarily and speed up, while others fall to earth. The objects appear in the western sky and stream to the east for 2 hours. Some are apparently linked together in groups of three, six, or eight, and all of them have some kind of trail. A few of them fall in the vicinity of K. G. Wettermark, who has also been observing. They resemble soap bubbles and dissipate quickly, leaving a film like cobweb.

**Date:** 8/13/1819

**Description:** 8:00–9:00 p.m. A brilliant white fireball streaks across the sky at Amherst, Massachusetts. The next morning, Erastus Dewey finds a strange substance 20 feet from his front door and assumes it is residue from the meteorite. It is about 8 inches in diameter, resembles an upside-down salad dish, and consists of buff-colored pulpy substance with an overwhelmingly bad smell. It is covered with a nap that, when removed, causes the interior to liquefy and form a starchy substance. A couple days later, it largely dissipates. Geologist [Edward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FHitchcock) [Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FHitchcock) thinks it is some kind of “gelatinous fungus” common to the area in the late summer.

### <a name="CFD2771A">Event 117 (CFD2771A)</a>
**Date:** 1824  
**Locations:** Munich, Germany; Moon; Schröter crater  
**Description:** Bavarian astronomer [Franz von Gruithuisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz%5Fvon%5FGruithuisen) of Munich, Germany, writes Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of their Colossal Buildings, in which he announces his discovery of a city on the Moon in the rough terrain to the north of Schröter crater that he names the Wallwerk. This region contains a series of somewhat linear ridges that have a fishbone-like pattern, and, with the small refracting telescope he is using, can be perceived as resembling buildings complete with streets. His claims are readily refuted using more powerful instruments. Gruithuisen also thinks that the mysterious “ashen light” observed on Venus’s dark side is due to a festival of fire in honor of the “ascension of a new emperor to the throne of the planet.” Later, he speculates that the illumination is caused by burning jungles to create new farmland.

**Date:** 11/13/1833  
**Description:** On this date in 1833 a series of incidents involving a luminous aerial object and the fall of mysterious jelly-like substances were reported in New York, New Jersey and Ohio. At dawn in West Point, New York, a woman milking her cow saw a luminous object descend "with a sposh" sound. She discovered a flattened, jelly-like transparent mass. By 10:00 in the morning it had sublimed and disappeared. The same kind of jelly-like substance was found on the ground in Newark and Rahway, New Jersey. In Poland, Ohio a luminous object in the northeastern sky, at dawn, hovered for nearly an hour. It was described as very brilliant, and was shaped like a "pruning hook." Earlier, at a short time after 2:00 a.m., a luminous object was also seen in the sky at Niagara Falls, New York. It was shaped like a square table, remained stationary in the sky, and emitted rays of light.

**Date:** 8/25/1835  
**End date:** 8/31/1835  
**Locations:** New York; America; Europe  
**Description:** The New York Sun publishes a series of six articles on the alleged discovery by English astronomer [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%5FHerschel) [Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%5FHerschel) of plants, animals, and winged people on the lunar surface. Using a huge and powerful telescope, Herschel supposedly sees herds of bison-like quadrupeds, a spherical amphibious creature, and a bipedal beaver that lives in huts. The humans are man-bats “covered, except on the face, with short and glossy copper-colored hair, and had wings composed of a thin membrane, without hair, lying snugly upon their backs.” The article is an elaborate hoax. Herschel hasn’t observed life on the moon at all, nor is Herschel even aware of the story until much later. The announcement causes enormous excitement throughout America and Europe. Authorship of the article is usually attributed to Richard Adams Locke, a reporter who is working for The Sun at the time. Locke publicly admits to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper New World, although his intent is satire, not misinformation.

**Locations:** Strait of Sicily; Licata, Sicily, Italy; Ainab, Lebanon  
**Description:** 10:30 p.m. The British brig Victoria, captained by [George Henry Caithness](https://molegenealogy.blogspot.com/2014/02/tracing-master-mariners-career.html)[,](https://molegenealogy.blogspot.com/2014/02/tracing-master-mariners-career.html) is becalmed in the Strait of Sicily about 30 miles southwest of Licata, Sicily, Italy, when a huge wind suddenly blows from the east for two hours. Then the wind suddenly stops, and the crew feels an overpowering heat and smells a sulfuric stench. At this moment three “luminous bodies” emerge from the sea about one-half mile away and remain visible for 10 minutes. Shortly thereafter the wind picks up again. \(This could be a magma plume from an undersea volcanic vent.\) Around 7:10 p.m., at Ainab, Lebanon, two objects five times as large as the moon, joined by “streamers or appendages,” are observed in the west and remain visible for one hour, moving slowly on an easterly course. The objects are so bright they are painful to look at. A possible outgassing event from the Madrepore subsea vent.

**Date:** 7/20/1860  
**Locations:** Brooklyn, New York; Texas State University–San Marcos; Hudson River; New York; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Norfolk  
**Description:** 9:40 p.m. A poem by Brooklyn, New York, poet [Walt Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt%5FWhitman)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt%5FWhitman) “Year of Meteors \(1859-60\),” published in a later edition of Leaves of Grass, describes a “strange huge meteor-procession dazzling and clear shooting over our heads.” For many years, no one could identify the event. Then in 2000, Texas State University–San Marcos physicist Donald W. Olson discovered a painting by Hudson River artist [Frederic Edwin Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic%5FEdwin%5FChurch) depicting two large meteors streaming across the sky and dated July 20, 1860. An examination of contemporary newspapers revealed that this was probably Whitman’s meteor procession. Around 9:40 p.m., two meteors with trails, one behind another, are seen in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Norfolk, and other locations in the East, proceeding slowly from northwest to southeast for nearly one minute. They are as bright as Venus. A rare event, and little understood until 1913, a meteor procession occurs when an earth-grazing meteor breaks apart and the fragments travel across the sky in the same horizontal path. Olson and his colleagues finally publish their discovery in the July 2010 issue of Sky & Telescope.

**Date:** 12/1865  
**Locations:** Durham, England; Whitburn; Tyne; Sunderland; Lizard Point  
**Description:** The British Board of Trade asks Trinity House to investigate the “false lights” of the Durham, England, coast, mysterious revolving lights seen above a rocky headland at Whitburn by mariners negotiating a hazardous stretch of the northeast coast. Between 1860 and 1870, more than 150 ships are wrecked on the rocks near Whitburn after following a light or lights in the sky that they wrongly believe are from a lighthouse at the mouth of the Tyne. A commission led by Rear Admiral [Richard Collinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%5FCollinson) meets in Sunderland on December 28 to interview witnesses and determine whether salvagers are responsible for the lights that are causing shipwrecks. Although the commission decides that the false lights are not deliberately lit, they are puzzled about the true cause. The lights and wrecks continue until January 1871 when the Souter Lighthouse is erected on Lizard Point.

**Description:** Engineer [Frederick William Birmingham](http://parramattaheritage.blogspot.com/2014/01/frederick-william-birmingham%5F9.html) of Parramatta, New South Wales, watches a bizarre procession of the faces of two prominent Australians \(Archbishop of Sydney [Frederic Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic%5FBarker) and New South Wales Premier [James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%5FMartin%5F%28Australian%5Fpolitician%29) [Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%5FMartin%5F%28Australian%5Fpolitician%29)\) through the air as well as a vessel he calls an “ark.” He hears a voice suggesting that “That’s a machine to go through the air.” The voice comes from a “spirit” whom he describes as “like a neutral tint shade and the shape of a man in his usual frock dress.” After the ark maneuvers for a while in the air, the spirit says, “Have you a desire or do you wish to enter upon it?” He is then lifted up and carried through the air into the object about 60 feet away. The spirit guides him into the “pilot house” of the machine where he is given some papers with formulas on them that will help him construct a flying machine. He observes another UFO-like craft on March 9, 1873, and later attempts to build a mechanical replica of what he has seen.

**Description:** Evening. Thomas Inman and his son are traveling home from the village of Taylorsville \[now Philo\], Ohio, and are possibly in Bristol Township when they see a bright light descending swiftly with a roaring noise. It strikes a short distance in the road \[probably Lawrence Road\] ahead of them, flickers and flares, then fades. A man dressed in a suit of black carrying a lantern emerges from the object. He walks a few paces and steps into a buggy, which Inman has not noticed before. The buggy begins to move silently and quickly, even though there is no horse attached to it, until it reaches a deep gully, into which it plunges and disappears.

**Description:** Astronomer [Giovanni Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%5FSchiaparelli) reports seeing canali on the Martian surface from Brera Observatory in Milan, Italy, during the Great Opposition. While the term “canals” indicates an artificial construction, its proper translation as “channels” implies that the observed features are natural configurations of the planetary surface. From the incorrect translation into the term “canals,” various assumptions are made about life on Mars; as these assumptions are popularized, the canals become famous, giving rise to waves of hypotheses, speculation, and fiction about the possibility of intelligent life on Mars—the Martians.

**Date:** 7/29/1878

**Description:** About 12:30 p.m. Astronomers [James Craig Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%5FCraig%5FWatson), director of the Ann Arbor \(Mich.\) Observatory, and [Lewis Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%5FSwift)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%5FSwift) an amateur from Rochester, New York, both claim to see a planet-like object close to the Sun during the total solar eclipse. Watson, observing from Separation, Wyoming, places the object about 2.5° southwest of the Sun and estimates its magnitude at 4.5. Swift, observing from a location near Denver, Colorado, sees what he takes to be an intra-mercurial planet about 3° southwest of the Sun. He estimates its brightness to be the same as that of Theta Cancri, a fifth-magnitude star which is also visible during totality, about six or seven minutes from the object. Both Watson and Swift describe the object as red in color. Watson says it has a definite disc, unlike stars, which appear as shimmering pinpoints of light.

**Description:** Night. The train depot operator and a few friends are walking at Galisteo, New Mexico, when they hear loud voices and laughter coming from a “large balloon” shaped like a fish approaching from the west. A flower is dropped from the car of the balloon to which is attached a slip of silk-like paper on which Chinese characters are written. The next morning, searchers find a cup of peculiar workmanship, but both artifacts are purchased by a “wealthy young Chinaman” and a “collector of curiosities” who visits town on March 28, although this part of the tale seems facetious and racist. The yarn is typical of sensational newspaper hoaxes that have no basis in reality.

**Location:** El Cerro de la Bufa Meteorological Observatory in Zacatecas, Mexico  
**Description:** Astronomer [José Árbol y Bonilla](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9%5F%C3%81rbol%5Fy%5FBonilla)[,](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9%5F%C3%81rbol%5Fy%5FBonilla) director of the El Cerro de la Bufa Meteorological Observatory in Zacatecas, Mexico, is observing the sun by eyepiece projection when he and an assistant see a large number of small bodies crossing the solar disc. Over the course of two days, they count a total of 447 dark objects. They seem bright as they approach the sun but are dark as they pass across its face. He takes several photographs and suspects that they are relatively near the earth. Mexican astronomers in 2011 suggested that a comet may have split into several pieces; these objects were estimated to have had a size of between 150 and 3,350 feet, and to have passed only 334 to 5,000 miles from the Earth; they thought a fragmented Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks was one possibility, in which case Earth barely avoided multiple Tunguska events or even a mass extinction; this was reported in the media and disputed in October 2011; but the source of these objects could also have been comet C/1883 D1 \(Brooks-Swift\) or even a third, unknown comet that year; the event also coincided with the annual Perseid meteor shower; even migrating birds cannot be ruled out.

Ellis and some of his ranch hands in south-central Dundy County, Nebraska, allegedly see a blazing object fall from the sky and crash into many pieces, burning the grass and fusing the sand. The light is so intense it blinds one of them. The newspaper suggests it is a “vessel belonging originally to some other planet.” The remains of the object are said to have dissolved in a rainstorm. However, the tale is actually a fictional story written by a correspondent in Benkelman.

**Description:** Night. Nine persons who are sleeping in a hut some 10 miles from Maracaibo, Venezuela, are awakened by a loud humming noise and a dazzling light that illuminates the interior. The people begin to pray but they start vomiting as extensive swellings appear on the upper part of their bodies, especially around the face and lips. They feel no heat, although the light has a smoky appearance and a peculiar smell. The next morning, the swellings subside but leave black blotches. By November 2, the skin peels off and the blotches are round sores. Portions of their hair falls off. Trees around the hut show no damage until November 2, when they suddenly wither. The symptoms are similar to those of ionizing radiation syndrome.

**Date:** 9/2/1891  
**Location:** Coyote Canyon [now within the Sandia National Laboratory complex], New Mexico  
**Description:** 8:00 p.m. [Alonzo M. Swan](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/62790371/alonzo-m-swan) and L. D. Dodson \(an equestrian recovering from an illness\) are camped in Coyote Canyon \[now within the Sandia National Laboratory complex\], New Mexico, to benefit from the mineral springs there when they see a brilliant light rise above a mountain to the south. As it moves closer against the wind, they see it has a series of “electric arc lights” around it and a “pole” or rudder that is similarly lit. The object is in view for nearly two hours. Another lighted object appears from the southwest and approaches the first object, but clouds prevent any further observation. Swan sees a lighted object again on September 4, although this time it could be a star.

They are visible until roughly 12:00 midnight, sometimes appearing as a mass, other times strung out more in an irregular line. The ship’s crew observes them again the next night as they are sailing east from Port Hamilton \[now the Korean islands of Geomundo\]. This time they are visible until dawn. Although there are some odd characteristics of this observation, the likeliest explanation is that they are inferior mirages of distant fishing boats, as atmospheric conditions are favorable on these dates.

**Location:** Flagstaff, Arizona  
**Description:** During the opposition of Mars, the idea that [Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%5FSchiaparelli)’s canali are really irrigation canals made by intelligent beings is first hinted at, and then adopted as the only intelligible explanation, by American astronomer [Percival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival%5FLowell) [Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival%5FLowell) in Flagstaff, Arizona, and a few others. The visible seasonal melting of Martian polar icecaps fuels speculation that an advanced alien race indigenous to Mars has built the canals to transport the water to drier equatorial regions. Newspaper and magazine articles about Martian canals and “Martians” capture the public imagination. Lowell publishes his views in three books: Mars \(1895\), Mars and Its Canals \(1906\), and Mars As the Abode of Life \(1908\). He remains a strong proponent for the rest of his life of the idea that the canals were built for irrigation by an intelligent civilization.

**Description:** Sunset. Bernard Parry and his wife are near Marriott \[now Marriott-Slaterville\], Utah, when they see a “small black cloud” in the northeast quickly approaching them. It grows bigger, then smaller, as they watch it. When it is only 450 feet away, it stops and hovers. Its sides seem to be folded up toward the center.

As it maneuvers near them, it opens several times, revealing various entities each time, from a crowned man to a “haughty woman” and a military leader. The original report appears in the Evangelical Visitor.

### <a name="90A526E6">Event 318 (90A526E6)</a>
**Date:** 1895  
**Location:** Mars  
**Description:** French parapsychologist [Albert de Rochas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert%5Fde%5FRochas) is asked to hypnotize a family friend, “Mireille,” who is suffering from some ailment. In one of her sessions, Mireille describes how she is rising in space, which she describes as luminous and peopled with phantoms. Subsequent sessions reveal that she has visited Mars and other planets in astral form. Mars has canals, of course, but also Martians who are less intelligent than earthlings.

### <a name="F0FFB861"></a> Event 319 (F0FFB861)
**Date:** 8/1895  
**Location:** Onondaga County, New York  
**Description:** US psychical researcher [James Hyslop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%5FHyslop) begins investigating a case of automatic writing by [Sarah Harper](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/158229771/sarah-harper-cleaveland) [Cleaveland](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/158229771/sarah-harper-cleaveland) \(“[Mrs. Smead](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/smead-mrs-ca-1902)”\) in Onondaga County, New York. She keeps records of her planchette experiments and puts them at Hyslop’s disposal. In August, she makes several references to the planet Mars and Jupiter. She provides a crude map of Jupiter’s surface, and the planet is said to be the “babies’ heaven.” At the next sitting, she draws a map of Mars, the different zones named in the Martian language; she gives several communications about the inhabitants and the canals. Martian revelations cease for another 5 years until September 1900, when the communications return in a developed state. She draws men, boats, houses, and flowers, named in Martian and written in hieroglyphic characters. Some of the sketches \(a self-winding double clock\) are very ingenious, while others \(a Martian airship\) are peculiar but unconvincing.

**Description:** Afternoon and evening. A mystery airship wave begins in California when residents of the Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento see a high-flying object moving slowly in a circle, leaving a trail of smoke.

### <a name="CD6502CB"></a> Event 347 (CD6502CB)
**Date:** 11/22/1896  
**Locations:** San Francisco; California; Maine; Oroville; Oakland; Havana, Cuba  
**Description:** San Francisco attorney [George D. Collins](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/87584075/george-daniel-collins) announces that he represents the airship inventor, a “very wealthy man who has been studying the subject of flying machines for fifteen years” and who moved to California from Maine in 1889. He claims the airship is a 150-foot metal contraption with two canvas wings 18 feet wide and shaped like a bird’s tail. It has been built in Oroville and is now hidden in the San Francisco, California, area as the inventor deals with technical problems. However, people in Oroville sense a hoax, as they know of no such inventor. On November 24, Collins complains to the San Francisco Call that another newspaper, the San Francisco Examiner, has been printing falsehoods about him, including an interview with another attorney, Frederick Bradley. Suspicion falls on an itinerant dentist from Maine, Elmer H. Benjamin, who insists his only inventions are dental fittings. A prominent citizen of Oakland, [George H. Carleton](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/95652037/george-henry-carleton), claims to know the inventor but has been sworn to secrecy. Former California Attorney General [William H. H. Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FH.%5FH.%5FHart) soon claims to represent the mystery inventor, who has fired Collins for talking too much. But Hart is also blabbing prolifically, saying that two or three airships exist \(a second built in an eastern state\) and his role is to “consolidate both interests.” Hart asserts that the airship can carry four men and 1,000 pounds of dynamite for dropping on Havana, Cuba.

**Date:** 11/25/1896  
**Location:** Lodi, California  
**Description:** 6:00 p.m. Col. H. G. Shaw and Camille Spooner are riding in a carriage near Lodi, California, when their horse stops suddenly. Looking up, they see three slender beings about 7 feet tall. Shaw walks up to them and asks them where they are from; they reply in an odd warbling language. He notes that they are hairless and wear no apparent clothing. The eyes are large and lustrous, and they each seem to be carrying and egg-shaped light and a breathing apparatus under the left arm. Shaw claims the beings try to lift him but they are not strong enough. They then notice a 150-foot airship hovering 20 feet above the water close to a bridge. The three beings float to the craft, open a door in the side, and disappear inside. The ship flies quickly out of sight. Shaw speculates that the beings are from Mars.

**Date:** 2/1897  
**End date:** 7/1897  
**Locations:** Nebraska; Colorado; Texas; Ohio  
**Description:** The mystery airship wave continues, from Nebraska and Colorado to Texas and Ohio. Hoaxes and pranks pollute the information pool in a major way during this era and the planet Venus and other celestial objects undoubtedly play a major role, but many airship reports emanate from manifestly sober, puzzled citizens, and they continue long after the initial excitement subsides. To all appearances, they are objects of some kind, but since newspapers rarely question witnesses critically about details at this time, little can be deduced from the mass of reports.

**Description:** 11:15 p.m. Frederick Chamberlain and O. L. Jones are riding one mile west of Lake Elmo, Minnesota, when they notice a figure in a clearing, walking around as if he is looking for something. They turn off the road to investigate and hear a cracking sound followed by a rushing noise. A moment later they notice a gray-white object that looks like the top of a covered wagon. It has two rows of four red or green lights. The object rises quickly at a sharp angle to clear the treetops. They can make out no machinery or wings or rudders or even an outline of the object. In the mud, Chamberlain finds 14 footprints, each 2 feet long, 6 inches wide, “arranged seven on each side, and in an oblong pattern.” Adam Thielen, a nearby farmer, independently sees a dark object with red and green lights flying overhead about the same time.

**Date:** 4/14/1897  
**Locations:** Howard City, Michigan; 3 miles northwest of Howard City, Michigan  
**Description:** 4:30 a.m. Farmers see an airship land about 3 miles northwest of Howard City, Michigan, and some go to investigate. Inside the craft is a “strange man” dressed in heavy furs although he seems “to have no use for them, as he was almost naked and seemed to be suffering from the heat.” The man is 9.5 feet tall and speaks in a musical language that, however, sounds like bellowing. One farmer gets too close, and the giant kicks him severely enough to break his hip.

In the shade cast by the craft lies a naked man with shoulder-length hair and a long beard. After a few minutes, Hopkins approaches the woman, who shrieks and runs toward the man. Hopkins speaks soothingly and the two aeronauts relax. Hopkins asks where they come from, and they point upward, pronouncing a word that sounds like “Mars.” The two examine Hopkins’s clothing, hair, and watch with great curiosity. They show him the interior of the ship but take off shortly afterward, “laughing and waving their hands.”

**Description:** 6:00 a.m. An airship is said to collide with the tower of Judge [James Spencer Proctor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35443870/james-spencer-proctor)’s windmill in Aurora, Texas, causing it to explode and strew debris over several acres. The pilot \(reportedly “not of this world,” or a “Martian” according to an alleged Army Signal Service officer named [Thomas Jefferson Weems](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17165126/thomas-jefferson-weems) from nearby Fort Worth\), does not survive the crash and is [buried](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/206580789/alien-unknown) “with Christian rites” at the Aurora Cemetery. Wreckage from the crash site is either dumped into a nearby well located under the damaged windmill or ends up with the alien in the grave. Adding to the mystery is the story of [Brawley Oates,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43968438/brawley-hoyle-oates) who purchases Judge Proctor’s property around 1935. Oates cleans out the debris from the well in order to use it as a water source, but later develops an extremely severe case of rheumatoid arthritis, which he claims is the result of contaminated water from the wreckage dumped into the well. As a result, Oates seals up the well with a concrete slab and places an outbuilding on the spot in 1945. The entire yarn is widely regarded as a hoax, although Proctor’s windmill apparently did exist.

**Date:** 4/20/1897  
**Locations:** Uvalde, Texas; Goshen, New York; Eagle Pass, Texas; San Angelo; Getty Street in Uvalde; Galveston; Fort Worth  
**Description:** 10:00 p.m. Sheriff [Henry W. Baylor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/33531179/henry-weidener-baylor) of Uvalde, Texas, sees a bright light and hears strange voices behind his house. He finds a landed airship and its crew of three men, one of whom is named “Wilson” \(from Goshen, New York\), who inquires after an acquaintance, [C. C. Akers](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/160043209/christopher-columbus-akers) of Eagle Pass, Texas. After procuring water from a hydrant in Baylor’s yard, the men board the airship, which speeds away northward toward San Angelo. County Clerk Henry J. Bowles sees the airship as it passes over Getty Street in Uvalde. Akers tells a reporter in Galveston that he knew a New Yorker named Wilson when he lived in Fort Worth in 1876–1877. Baylor’s seemingly compelling testimony disintegrates after he confesses in late May to making the whole story up, possibly in collusion with Akers.

**Date:** 4/20/1897  
**Description:** Capt. James Hooton was hunting in the vicinity of Homan, Arkansas when he heard the noise of a steam engine and found an object in a clearing. It looked like a cylinder with pointed ends, lateral wheels, and had a horizontal blade overhead. Hooton spoke with a man who wore dark glasses and walked behind the craft. There were three or four occupants in total. The witness was told this was indeed "The Airship" and that it used compressed air for propulsion. Capt.

**Locations:** Lancaster; Baltimore, Ohio  
**Description:** 8:00 p.m. A man is riding his horse between Lancaster and Baltimore, Ohio, when something scares his horse. He sees an object with two brilliant white lights on either end landing in a nearby field. He tethers his horse and approaches the object, which seems as large as a house. Inside he can see two men conversing, so he walks up to ask them questions. One of the aeronauts seems to be Japanese and the other speaks English with a British accent. The craft is called the Aeribarque, and they are on a test flight. The aeronaut says that they often land in remote areas and come to nearby towns for supplies or mechanical parts, posing either as tourists or “harmless cranks trying to invent perpetual motion.” After giving the witness a demonstration of the electrical lighting system, they take off into the sky.

**Date:** 4/25/1897  
**Location:** Merkel, Texas  
**Description:** Evening. As some residents of Merkel, Texas, are leaving a church service, they notice a heavy, anchor- shaped object being dragged by a large rope that is attached to an airship in the sky not far above them. After 10 minutes, a small figure dressed in a blue sailor suit starts climbing down the rope. But when he sees people watching him, he cuts the rope and returns to the airship, which moves away to the northeast. The anchor goes on exhibit at a local blacksmith shop.

**Date:** 4/25/1897  
**Description:** People returning from church in Merkel, Texas observed a heavy object being dragged along the ground by a rope attached to a flying craft. The rope got caught in a railroad track.

**Date:** 10/4/1898  
**Locations:** Italy; Greenville; Garland; Blossom, Texas; Sherman  
**Description:** 9:00 p.m. A brilliant object passes over Italy, Greenville, Garland, and Blossom, Texas. Initially moving in an easterly direction, it seems to change course and shoot upwards then burst, throwing out three distinct objects, one red, the other white, and the last one blue. The red and blue lights die out, but the white one continue a few seconds before it too bursts, emitting a shower of sparks. Blossom merchant Dick Moore says the light is so glaring that he thinks his “house was falling on him.” About 2.5 miles north of Sherman, 12-year-old George Campbell is riding with his father when they see the fireball descending, apparently coming as close as 3 feet above the ground before moving upward; they can hear a buzzing noise and think the object is about 10 feet in diameter.

**Description:** Night. At Fort Washita, Oklahoma, Mrs. William Peveto \(possibly [Mary Peveto](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6822240/mary-e-peveto)\) watches a fireball \(probably the same one as October 4\) descend. A few minutes later, distracted by the meteor, she is standing in her kitchen when a “female ghost” appears and chats with her for a few minutes, saying that if she would follow her, she will lead her to a fortune. Peveto becomes terrified, and the entity flees through a closed door. The entity visits her again on other nights, again talking about treasure in the basement. They continue until February 1899 when they occur nightly. At one point the ghost claims to have been murdered years ago in Fort Washita and shows her strangle marks around her neck. Poltergeist phenomena \(tables moving\) occur and a male ghost also talks to her. Peveto becomes ill and apparently moves away from the place.

### <a name="6976439F">Event 628 (6976439F)</a>
**Date:** 1899  
**Locations:** Colorado Springs, Colorado; Europe; Mars  
**Description:** Serbian-American inventor [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola%5FTesla) is working in his laboratory near Colorado Springs, Colorado, when he observes unusual signals from his receiver that he speculates are communications from another planet. He mentions them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treat it as a sensational story and jump to the conclusion Tesla is hearing signals from Mars. In 1901, Tesla writes that it has not been immediately apparent to him that he is hearing “intelligently controlled signals” and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It is possible that he is intercepting [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo%5FMarconi)’s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S \(dot dot dot\) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission. [Brian Dunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%5FDunning%5F%28author%29) of the Skeptoid podcast attributes Tesla’s signals to pulsars, which are not identified until 1968.

The steamer [USS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FSupply%5F%281872%29) [Supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FSupply%5F%281872%29) is transporting the ill Governor of Guam, [William Elbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FElbridge%5FSewell) [Sewell,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FElbridge%5FSewell) from Guam to San Francisco, California. About 300 miles west-southwest of San Francisco, commanding Lt. [Frank Herman Schofield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%5FHerman%5FSchofield) observes three objects “beneath the clouds, their color a rather bright red.” As they approach the ship they appear to soar, passing above the broken clouds. After rising above the clouds, they appear to “be moving directly away from the earth. The largest had an apparent area of about six suns. It was egg-shaped, the larger end forward. The second was about twice the size of the sun, and the third, about the size of the sun. Their near approach to the surface appeared to be most remarkable.” The objects are in sight for over two minutes by three people. [Barry Greenwood](http://www.noufors.com/Barry%5FJ%5FGreenwood.htm) thinks they are meteors, but [Bruce Maccabee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce%5FMaccabee) is not so sure.

### <a name="90CDC3B7"></a> Event 671 (90CDC3B7)
**Date:** 2/28/1904  
**Description:** At 35.97 N 128.60 W in the Pacific Ocean between Honolulu and San Francisco at 6:10 a.m., three large dull red bodies flew in from the northwest over the U.S.S. Navy ship Supply. The largest one was egg or pear shaped, and six times the apparent size of the sun. The objects flew in an eschelon formation, flying very fast below the clouds. They gained altitude, turned, and travelled off to the west-northwest while climbing above broken clouds. There were at least three sailors as witnesses, including the main witness named Schofield. The duration of the event was more than two minutes.

**Date:** 6/1904  
**Location:** Rolling Prairie, Indiana  
**Description:** 10:00 p.m. When Tony Darby goes outside to the well on his farm 5 miles north of Rolling Prairie, Indiana, he notices two round, orange-colored, silent objects hovering 5–6 feet from the ground near the barn. He estimates they are the size of wagon wheels. One of the objects is 2 feet behind and to the left of the other. Running back to the house, he calls for his mother and brother, and all three walk toward the objects, which move away slightly then stop when the witnesses stop. Soon the objects move steadily away to the northeast, still maintaining their relative positions, at about the speed of a man walking. They pause briefly in a small hollow, then continue over a small hill and out of sight.

**Description:** [Herbert Vern DeMott,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/148816945/herbert-vern-demott) 10, watches an object come down near his family’s water well in Mitchell, South Dakota. As he approaches it, a door rolls back and he is welcomed inside by two human-like occupants who are sitting inside on camp stools. They converse with him fluently, but he does not know where they come from. He sees a lever that apparently can cut off the earth’s “magnetism,” allowing the object to rise. The occupants take water from the farm’s horse trough to be “used in making electricity.”

**Location:** 10 miles southeast of Anadarko, Oklahoma  
**Description:** Dusk. Roy Russell and four other cotton-pickers are taking a brief respite from work 10 miles southeast of Anadarko, Oklahoma, when they see a fiery object shaped like a stovepipe. From an initial altitude of 60 feet, the object sinks down, comes toward them, and passes within 16 feet at eye level. Then it seems to flatten out and just blacks out. Another similar object follows and then several others. Russell watches them for 20 minutes.

**Locations:** Burlington, Vermont; Church and College streets; College Street  
**Description:** Just before 12:00 noon. Bishop [John Stephen Michaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%5FStephen%5FMichaud) is talking with Vermont ex-governor [Urban A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban%5FA.%5FWoodbury) [Woodbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban%5FA.%5FWoodbury) at the corner of Church and College streets in Burlington, Vermont, when they hear a loud explosion and see a torpedo-shaped object about 6 feet long and 8 inches in diameter suspended in the air about 300 feet away. It is dark, with several tongues of flame issuing from it at various points, as if its covering is ruptured. It slowly begins to move to the southeast. The explosion has either knocked down or stunned a horse in College Street. A strong downpour of rain ensues shortly afterward. Although described as a “possible case of ball lightning,” the object appears more likely to have been an exploded balloon that someone has attached fireworks to in preparation for a Fourth of July celebration.

**Date:** 7/2/1907  
**Description:** Burlington, Vermont. The Bishop John Michaud was standing on a Burlington street corner around 2 in the afternoon, engaged in a conversation with Ex-Governor Woodbury and Mr. A.A. Buell, when without warning they were startled by what sounded like a nearby explosion. Looking eastward along College Street they observed a torpedo-shaped object, some 300 feet away, hovering in the air about 50 feet over the tops of the buildings. It was estimated to be about 6 feet long and 8 inches in diameter. It was dark, with red flames being emitted from spots on the surface resembling unburnished copper. The object began to move slowly toward the south. As it moved the surface seemed to be rupturing in places, and through these ruptures came the intense red flames.

### <a name="497D0B8C"></a> Event 711 (497D0B8C)
**Date:** 6/30/1908  
**Locations:** Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate [now Krasnoyarsk Krai], Russia; Lake Baikal; Eastern Siberian taiga  
**Description:** 7:14 a.m. A large explosion takes place near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate \[now Krasnoyarsk Krai\], Russia. Evenki natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of Lake Baikal observe a column of bluish light, nearly as bright as the sun, moving across the sky. About 10 minutes later, there is a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion report that the source of the sound moves from the east to the north of them. The sounds are accompanied by a shock wave that knocks people off their feet and breaks windows hundreds of kilometers away. The explosion over the sparsely populated eastern Siberian taiga flattens 770 square miles of forest and possibly causes up to three human casualties. The event is generally attributed to the air burst of a meteoroid. It is classified as an impact event, even though no impact crater has been found. The object disintegrates at an altitude of 3–6 miles rather than hitting the surface of the Earth. The area is so remote that the site is not inspected until 1927 by a team led by Russian mineralogist [Leonid Kulik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid%5FKulik), who finds a zone about 5 miles across where trees are scorched and devoid of branches but still standing upright. More exotic explanations for the event include a black hole impact, antimatter, a UFO crash \(as recently as 2004 by Russian ufologist Yuri Labvin\), a nuclear explosion, and an inadvertent experiment by [Nikola Tesla](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nikola%5FTesla).

### <a name="8130FD80"></a> Event 712 (8130FD80)
**Date:** 6/30/1908  
**Description:** On this morning at 7:17 a.m. the Tunguska, Russia explosion occurred in a remote region of the Siberian taiga, which brightened the pre-dawn sky as far away as London and had the equivalent energy of a 15 to 40-megaton nuclear explosion. Detailed scientific analysis shows that the object that caused the devastation exploded above an altitude of three miles and left an area of destruction for more than 850 square miles, in a heart-shaped pattern. It is widely thought to have been either an asteroid or comet impact, but it has sometimes been interpreted as the crash or mid-air explosion of an alien spaceship. Several anomalies still remain to be explained if the explosion was caused by a celestial body entering Earth's atmosphere. For example, why was radioactive Cesium 137 found in 1908 tree rings from the area.

**Locations:** Forestville neighborhood of Bristol, Connecticut; Lake Compounce; Massachusetts  
**Description:** About 6:00 p.m. A “large airship sailing very high” is seen passing from north to south over the Forestville neighborhood of Bristol, Connecticut. It seems to be an elongated gas bag under which a framework with a propeller is suspended. After “maneuvering” a while, it stops and circles over Lake Compounce then changes course toward the southwest. An East Bristol man named Wilson later claims it was a pig-shaped balloon he had sent up for his daughter’s birthday party, but “balloon” sightings continue in Massachusetts through December.

### <a name="42010464"></a> Event 758 (42010464)
**Date:** 5/18/1909  
**Locations:** Senghenydd; Cardiff, South Wales; Caerphilly Mountain  
**Description:** 11:00 p.m. Charles Lethbridge \(part-time dock worker and Punch-and-Judy showman\) is traveling on a “spring cart” from Senghenydd on his way home to Cardiff, South Wales. At the summit of Caerphilly Mountain he sees a long, tube-shaped object sitting on the grass by the roadside, with two men busily working on something. They are wearing heavy fur coats and fur caps that fit tightly over the heads. Lethbridge proceeds to about 60 feet of them when they notice him and start jumping up and jabbering in a foreign language. They quickly pick up something from the ground, then jump into a little carriage suspended from the object \(with wheels at the bottom\), which rises into the air in a zig-zag fashion. When it clears the telegraph wires, two electric lights shine out and the craft heads toward the southeast. Lethbridge returns to the site with a newspaper reporter and they find signs of trampling in the grass for about 45 feet. They also pick up a small red French military label, letterhead from a London stockbroker, many newspaper clippings with references to airships or the German army, and a tin box with paste for polishing metal.

**Description:** During the opposition of Mars, astronomer [Eugène Antoniadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.%5FM.%5FAntoniadi) uses the 83cm aperture telescope at Meudon Observatory in Paris, France, to observe Mars.

The outstanding photos of Mars taken at the new Baillaud dome at the Pic du Midi Observatory in the French Pyrenees also bring formal discredit to the Martian canal theory, and the notion of canals begins to fall out of favor. Around this time, spectroscopic analysis also begins to show that no water is present in the Martian atmosphere.

**Date:** 12/22/1909  
**Locations:** Worcester, Massachusetts; Marlboro; Boston; New York City  
**Description:** 6:30 p.m. Many residents of Worcester, Massachusetts, see a “brilliant ray” emitted by a large black object 1,000 feet high in the southwestern sky. After circling over the town, the object heads to the west, where it is seen over Marlboro. It returns to Worcester between 7:00 and 7:30 p.m., flying at low altitude and sporting a searchlight. One policeman thinks he sees enormous wings; others detect one or two figures inside. The airship is attributed to a Worcester businessman named [Wallace E. Tillinghast,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%5FTillinghast) who has told the Boston Herald on December 12 that he has invented a heavier-than-air monoplane and has made more than 100 test flights at night to Boston and New York City. But Tillinghast never offers his aircraft for public viewing, and people gradually realize it is a hoax.

### <a name="CDC1CEC7"></a> Event 881 (CDC1CEC7)
**Date:** 2/9/1913  
**Locations:** Canada; northeastern United States; Bermuda; Brazil; Michigan; New York; Pennsylvania; Ontario; Toronto  
**Description:** 9:00 p.m. An earth-grazing meteor procession is seen from locations across Canada, the northeastern United States, and Bermuda, and from many ships at sea, including eight off Brazil, giving a total recorded ground track of over 7,000 miles. The meteors are particularly unusual in that there is no apparent radiant—no point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate. Witnesses are surprised to see a procession of between 40 and 60 bright, slow-moving fireballs moving from horizon to horizon in a practically identical path. Individual fireballs are visible for at least 30 to 40 seconds, and the entire procession takes some 5 minutes to cross the sky. Subsequent observers also note a large, white, tailless body bringing up the rear, but the various bodies making up the procession continue to disintegrate and travel at different rates throughout their course, so that by the time observations are made in Bermuda, the leading bodies are described as “like large arc lights in appearance, slightly violet in colour,” followed closely by yellow and red fragments. Research carried out in the 1950s by [Alexander D. Mebane](https://rr0.org/people/m/MebaneAlexander/) uncovers a handful of reports from newspaper archives in the northern United States. At Escanaba, Michigan, the Press states the “end of the world was apprehended by many” as numerous meteors travel across the northern horizon. In Batavia, New York, a few observers see the meteors and many people hear a thundering noise, while other reports are made in Nunda and Dansville, New York \(where several residents again think the world is ending\) and Osceola, Pennsylvania. The observations are analyzed in detail later in 1913 by the astronomer [Clarence Chant,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence%5FChant) leading him to conclude that as all accounts are positioned along a great circle arc, the source is a small, short-lived natural satellite of the Earth. One curious feature of the reports, highlighted by Mebane, is that several appear to indicate a second meteor procession on the same course around 5 hours later, although the Earth’s rotation means that there is no obvious mechanism to explain this. One observer, A. W. Brown from Thamesville, Ontario, reports seeing both the initial meteor procession and a second one on the same course at 2:20 a.m. the next day. Chant’s original report also refers to a series of three groups of “dark objects” that pass on the same course as the previous meteors from west to east over Toronto on the afternoon of February 10, which he suggests are “something of a meteoric nature.”

**Locations:** Georgian Bay, Ontario; small cove along the shore of Georgian Bay, Ontario  
**Description:** William J. Kiehl, 18, is with seven others in a small cove along the shore of Georgian Bay, Ontario. They see a strange machine on the surface of the lake. Two little men wearing square masks and purple-green coveralls are working with a hose leading from the water to inside the UFO. Three other figures, dressed in khaki, are adjusting some rods that are pulsating with various colors. The beings notice the group watching them and run into the machine, which starts vibrating with colors. It starts to ascend, but one being has not made it inside and is hanging on. After hovering 12 feet in the air to balance itself, it rapidly accelerates upward. A likely hoax.

**Date:** 9/9/1914  
**Locations:** West Norwood, south London, England; Ashstead, Surrey  
**Description:** Mid-day. Amateur astronomer [William Herbert Steavenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FHerbert%5FSteavenson) points his 3-inch refracting telescope in West Norwood, south London, England, at the planet Mercury, then about 8° distant from the Sun, when a round, luminous object the apparent size of the planet, but brighter, speeds across his field, passing centrally from south to north in about 3 seconds. A few seconds later, another appears going in the same direction. More follow, and the display continues until at least 3:00 p.m. when the sky becomes overcast. He watches several hundred bodies pass; about half are perfectly round and the rest are dumbbell shaped. All the objects are well defined and intrinsically brighter than Venus. The prevailing color is yellowish white. Steavenson sends a telegram to the Rev. [T. E. R. Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.%5FE.%5FR.%5FPhillips) at Ashstead, Surrey, but the sky is now overcast and he cannot confirm the observation. Steavensen thinks high-altitude seeds are the most likely explanation.

**Description:** 9:30 p.m. Two British Naval Intelligence officers, Lt. Col. [William Price Drury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FPrice%5FDrury) and Lt. C. Brownlow, on Dartmoor, Devon, England, watch a “bright white light, considerably larger in appearance than a planet” ascend steadily from a meadow to a height of 50–60 feet. It then swings 300 feet or so to the left and suddenly vanishes. The officers have been investigating reports of similar lights seen in the region during the summer. In December, GHQ Home Forces issues a 16-page confidential report on the investigation and concludes there is “no evidence on which to base a suspicion that this class of enemy activity ever existed” and that 89% of the reports are explained. Some “moving lights in the air” are attributed to marsh gas.

### <a name="02944276"></a> Event 970 (02944276)
**Date:** 10/13/1917  
**Location:** Cova da Iria, Portugal  
**Description:** After some newspapers report that the Virgin Mary has promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathers at Cova da Iria, Portugal. What happens then becomes known as the “Miracle of the Sun.” Various claims are made as to what really happened. The three children report seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John de Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher who wrote several books on the subject, included descriptions by witnesses who believe they observed a miracle created by Mary, the mother of Jesus. After a period of rain, the dark clouds break and the Sun appears as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It appears significantly duller than normal and casts multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The Sun then seems to careen towards the earth before zigzagging back to its normal position. Witnesses report that their previously wet clothes become “suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling.” Not all witnesses report seeing the Sun “dance.” Some people only see the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, see nothing at all. The only known picture of the Sun taken during the event does not show anything unusual. No unusual solar phenomena are observed by scientists. Some theologians, scientists, and skeptics have offered alternative explanations that include psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, a sundog, and optical effects caused by natural meteorological phenomena. The Miracle of the Sun is interpreted by others as a UFO event. Investigator [Joe Nickell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe%5FNickell) thinks that the effects are “a combination of factors, including optical effects and meteorological phenomena, such as the sun being seen through thin clouds, causing it to appear as a silver disc. Other possibilities include an alteration in the density of the passing clouds, causing the sun’s image to alternately brighten and dim and so seem to advance and recede, and dust or moisture droplets in the atmosphere refracting the sunlight and thus imparting a variety of colors.”

### <a name="F3A9AB4E"></a> Event 971 (F3A9AB4E)
**Date:** 10/13/1917  
**Description:** Approximately 70,000 people crowded the fields surrounding the Cova da Iria, a grotto in Fatima, Portugal to witness a promised miracle. Miraculous events and apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary had been occurring monthly on the 13th of every month since three children--Lucia, Jesus and Marto-- had first met a mysterious lady in blue there in May. Not many of those in the crowd, even those close to the three children, were able to witness the apparition of the Lady on this day, but it is reported that everyone present saw "something." The most common description was of a "gyrating sun" that became a silver disc, and emitted bright rainbow shafts of light, changing colors in succession from red to violet to blue to yellow. The flat silver disc plunged downward toward earth in a zigzag fashion. Catholics present interpreted these events as a sign from God, and the religious event was later sanctioned as a miracle by the Roman Catholic Church. The prophesies revealed that day have been kept secret by the Vatican, but reportedly involve the assassination of "the last Pope."

**Description:** After 10:00 p.m. A brilliant light the size of a tennis ball appears in a garden at Shuttlewood, Derbyshire, England. When the witness approaches it, it moves away at a leisurely pace and passes through wire netting. It follows the top of a hedge, turns right, and ascends until it finds a break in the high branches of a tree, where it hovers for 3 minutes before flying on. The witness then notices his neighbor’s farm is illuminated with bright white light. Several minutes later, the sphere returns to the garden, hovers another 3 minutes, then approaches the witness. As it does so, it turns from white to orange. It moves away, stops above a neighbor’s garden, travels along a hedge, traverses a field, and circles a row of houses before soaring into the sky and disappearing. The light is seen for 40 minutes.

They turn and see a brown-green object under a tree near a creek 75 feet from them. They notice a similarly colored figure standing in a door that has been lowered down. It makes strange guttural sounds. They see another figure running toward the stream leading to a pond. This smaller one dips up some water into a can. The larger figure seems to be hurrying the smaller figure back into the object. The door slams shut with a metallic sound, and the vehicle rises up quickly with its three legs still out and goes over a hill.

**Date:** 1922  
**Location:** County Donegal, Ireland  
**Description:** County Donegal, Ireland: Irish Republic Army man, Lawrence Bradley, wrote to the editor of “Watfordand West-Hersts Post” magazine (4/30/64) that while he was fighting a scattered rear-guard, mostly in the mountains of Donegal, he came upon a cave with vegetation at the entrance that had been scorched. The only occupants in the cave were the sick and the wounded that had been unable to walk. The six able-bodied soldiers that were looking after them said they had been awakened early pre-dawn by a whirring noise outside of the cave and had fired their rifles in the direction of the noise, thinking that it was an armored car. Suddenly the object retaliated by firing jets of flame at the cave entrance. After near suffocation, the soldiers ran out to see the flame throwing UFO ascending into the sky. Clearly visible, it was circular in shape and glowing and of a shiny metal.

**Description:** Mars enters an opposition closer to Earth than at any time in the century before. In the US, a National Radio Silence Day is promoted during a 36-hour period in August 21–23, with all radios quiet for 5 minutes on the hour, every hour, just in case the Martians take the opportunity to communicate with Earth. At the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., an SE-950 radio receiver is lifted 1.9 miles above the ground in a dirigible tuned to a wavelength between 8 and 9 kilometers, using a “radio photo message continuous transmission machine” recently invented by Amherst College and [Charles Francis Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FFrancis%5FJenkins) of Washington. The program is led by retired astronomer [David Peck Todd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FPeck%5FTodd) with the military assistance of Chief of Naval Operations Adm. [Edward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FWalter%5FEberle) [Walter Eberle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FWalter%5FEberle)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FWalter%5FEberle) with [William F.

The device records radio signals on chemically treated film. One signal consists of a “fairly regular arrangement of dots and dashes along one side” and on the other “at almost evenly spaced intervals … curiously jumped groups each taking the forms of a crudely drawn human face.” Todd tells a reporter, “It may not be a message from Mars, but if it isn’t from Mars, where is it from?” Astronomer [Frederick E. Fowle](https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris%5Fsic%5F14002) of the Smithsonian thinks they are “disturbances introduced by solar or terrestrial causes not yet understood.” Other scientists suggest the images are caused by static discharge from a passing trolley car, malfunctioning radio equipment, or the natural symphonic radio waves produced by Jupiter.

### <a name="B4B58D47"></a> Event 1065 (B4B58D47)
**Date:** 10/27/1926  
**Location:** London, England  
**Description:** Attorney and “telepathist” Hugh Mansfield Robinson, who has been in contact with a female Martian entity named Oomaruru since 1918, convinces the central radio office in London, England, to send out a message, “MMM opesti nipitia secomba” over the airwaves. He intends for it to be picked up by Martian wireless. The next day, he claims that Oomaruru telepathically told him that only the first three letters had been received. Robinson describes the Martians as 7–8 feet tall with large ears, a wealth of black hair, and almond eyes. Over the years he continues receiving messages from Oomaruru while in a trance and attempting to send signals to Mars. Psychic investigator [Nandor Fodor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandor%5FFodor), who has attended some of Robinson’s séances, calls him “as slippery as a human eel.”

**Date:** 1929  
**Locations:** Hertford, England; Orchard  
**Description:** In Hertford, England, a 5-year-old girl and her 8-year-old brother have such an unsettling experience that they do not talk about it themselves until about 1960, and the woman herself does not reveal it to outsiders until 1970. They are playing in a garden when they hear engine sounds and see a tiny \(12 or 15 inches wide\) biplane coming over the fence from the direction of an orchard. It swoops down, nearly hitting a trash can, and lands for a few seconds before resuming its flight. While it is stationary, the girl can see a “perfectly proportioned tiny pilot wearing a leather flying helmet, who waved to us as he took off.”

**Date:** 1930  
**Locations:** Texas; Colorado  
**Description:** 10:00 a.m. A woman is driving the family car in an isolated hilly area of Texas when she rounds a curve and sees a huge object about 100 feet across by the side of the road. A small door is open with steps leading down to the ground. One side of the object is braced up by two slender legs with round plates for feet. A man of normal size comes walking toward her and forces her to stop. He seems to speak to her telepathically, telling her to leave the road and make a shortcut through a gully. Some 8–10 other figures walk forward, much smaller and with slanted eyes. They are wearing tan coveralls and tight caps. Despite potential damage to her car, she drives through the gully as the larger man walks alongside. The next thing she remembers is walking up to her porch at her home 15 miles away. It is around 12:00 midnight. In March 1968, having read Interrupted Journey about the Betty and Barney Hill case, she writes to the Colorado project and offers herself for hypnosis and research. [Edward Condon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FCondon) files the letter under “psychological” and does not respond.

It travels at a height of about 3 feet above the ground at a constant speed of about 10–15 mph and enters a thick patch of undergrowth. Marsala runs after it for about a half mile and notices that the bushes part in front of the object and close up after it passes. His companion is frightened and insists on returning to the village.

They are something people of this earth have never seen.” Their ships “are round like the moon with airtight shutter at the front, glass. The machine must be built with some light material, airproof fireproof, waterproof. The inside must be like a room, 2 beds tables & chairs.” Much of her information seems to be derived from articles in the Auckland Star about conditions elsewhere in the solar system.

**Description:** During a time of personal crises, the witness, now a retired pastor, found himself in a city of 16,000 located 150 miles west of Toronto, Ontario. On this particular night he was standing on a street lit up by a brilliant white light from above. Looking up, he saw the light came from a round cloud with a scalloped edge, about 200 yards overhead. From the cloud-like object streamed down a light like a laser beam. He next saw a young man with golden hair standing beside him, dressed in a suit of a similar color. The man had radiant blue eyes, and was about 5.5 feet tall. He smiled at the witness and told him that his work would be in that city, and reminded him that “the cottages in the rear of the mansion are as important as those who dwell in the mansion.” He told him the witness would reside there for six years and would then work his way to the west coast. According to the man’s account, the prophecies were fulfilled.

### <a name="0193BBB4"></a> Event 1162 (0193BBB4)
**Date:** Summer 1933  
**Locations:** Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan; Napawin  
**Description:** For weeks, strange lights in the sky are reported around Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan. Curious about the reports, two young men and a woman drive to the lake from Napawin. On their way they see a glow near the horizon, so they park and trek a quarter mile into the woods where they can see a large, oval-shaped craft sitting on legs. From an open central doorway shines a bright orange glow; a ladderlike stairway extends downward with a dozen figures dressed in silver suits moving up and down the steps. They appear to be repairing the craft. The witnesses watch for 30 minutes when they decide to return to their truck and get closer. Two nights later they return and find imprints and burn marks, which they photograph. Two of them write an article that they submit to magazines, which refuse to publish what they consider outlandish fiction.

### <a name="9E1050E1"></a> Event 1163 (9E1050E1)
**Date:** Summer 1933  
**Location:** Cherryville, Pennsylvania  
**Description:** 2:30 a.m. A man who still insists on anonymity in 1964 is driving near Cherryville, Pennsylvania, when his car gets a flat tire. As he is jacking it up, he sees a faint violet light in the field on his right. Curious, he walks about 200 feet toward the light and sees a bell-shaped object about 10 feet in diameter and 6 feet high on the grass. Light is issuing from a circular door about 1 foot in diameter. He pushes it and it swings open. Putting his head inside, he cannot see much because of the peculiar light coming from the ceiling. The chamber inside is about 6 feet in diameter, 4 feet high, and full of tubing and dials on a console. An ammonia scent pervades the room, which is notably chilly. The man then walks around the object, touching the surface, which is slick, metallic, and cold. After 10 minutes, he goes back to the car, replaces the tire, and drives home.

**Description:** 6:00 p.m. Witnesses in Kalix, Norrbotten, Sweden, see beams of light coming from a machine that seems to be searching the ground below. The beams are “blinding.” The sighting is part of a wave of “ghost flier” reports of gray monoplanes without identifying markings that are reported over rural areas of Scandinavia from November 15, 1933, through February 11, 1934. The Swedish Military Record Office accumulates 96 reports from Sweden, 234 from Norway, and 137 from Finland, and the Swedish Air Force undertakes at least two reconnaissance missions in search of the mystery planes. More than 50% of the reports take place between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., when Venus is low over the horizon.

**Date:** 10/30/1938  
**Locations:** New York City; US; Germany; Russia  
**Description:** 8:00 p.m. “The War of the Worlds” episode of the American radio drama anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air, directed and narrated by actor and future filmmaker [Orson Welles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson%5FWelles), is an adaptation of [H. G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.%5FG.%5FWells) [Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.%5FG.%5FWells)’s novel The War of the Worlds \(1898\). It is performed and broadcast live in New York City as a Halloween episode over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network. The episode becomes famous for allegedly causing panic among its listening audience, though the scale of that panic is disputed as the program has relatively few listeners. In the days after the adaptation, widespread outrage is expressed in the media. The program’s news-bulletin format is described as deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the broadcasters and calls for regulation by the FCC, which declines. Some government agencies in the US, Germany, and Russia take note of how segments of the population are easily manipulated into thinking fiction is fact. According to [Annie Jacobsen,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie%5FJacobsen) the confusion allegedly inspires [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%5FStalin) to create a similar scenario with a fake alien crash in the US.

**Date:** Early 8/1939  
**Locations:** Armășești, Romania; Bucharest  
**Description:** George Pârvu and four other schoolchildren are playing in an open field in Armășești, Romania, when they see a bright light in the sky moving in a zigzag fashion. It circles a few times then descends in their direction, getting bigger and brighter. The egg-shaped object hovers silently at an altitude of 230–260 feet. Suddenly it becomes a dull coppery color and lands about 140 feet away. Two of the children flee but Pârvu and two others remain. The bottom of the object has a ring of small turbine blades that look like paddles in a water mill. It seems to be 16 feet high. A hatch opens and two little men about 4 feet tall come out, dressed in gray diving suits. They walk toward the children, one of them holding a rectangular box pointing at the ground. The children approach them, holding hands, but when they are about 23 feet away the other man points a thick stick-like device at them and they are no longer able to move forward. The little men bow in their direction, waist deep, then turn around and reenter the object, which takes off. The children find a circular area of yellowed grass where the object had been. Pârvu feels energized, but one of the other boys is temporarily sick. Pârvu encounters what he perceives to be the same object in August 1944, August 1949, and the summer of 1954 \(in the center of Bucharest\).

**Description:** Hungarian-American physicist [Leo Szilárd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo%5FSzilard) writes a confidential letter to [President Roosevelt,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%5FD.%5FRoosevelt) in consultation with fellow Hungarian physicists [Edward Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FTeller) and [Eugene Wigner.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene%5FWigner) He has persuaded [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert%5FEinstein) to sign it as well. The letter warns that Germany might develop atomic bombs and suggests that the United States should start its own nuclear program. It results in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the US government, and ultimately to the creation of the Manhattan Project. Delayed by the outbreak of war in Europe, the letter is eventually hand-delivered to Roosevelt by economist [Alexander Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%5FSachs) on October 11. Roosevelt gives the letter to his aide, Brig. Gen. [Edwin “Pa” Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin%5F%22Pa%22%5FWatson) with the instruction: “Pa, this requires action!”

**Date:** Late Summer 1939  
**Location:** Fort Worth, Texas  
**Description:** A girl sleeping in the back yard of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, is awakened by a whirring noise. She sees a small object approaching from the east at an altitude of 20–30 feet. When it gets close, it descends to the level of her bed and hovers briefly at the foot, so close that she can touch it. It has the shape of an “old-time Mississippi steamboat with a deck around the bottom.” Strata or veins run through it, and a soft, blue-green glow surrounds it. It is 3 feet around and 1 foot high. It rises suddenly and disappears.

**Locations:** US; Columbia University  
**Description:** US physicist [John R.

**Date:** 3/1940  
**Locations:** University of Birmingham in England; Australia  
**Description:** [Otto Robert Frisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto%5FRobert%5FFrisch) and [Rudolf Peierls,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf%5FPeierls) two researchers at the University of Birmingham in England—who ironically have been assigned to investigate nuclear weapons by Australian physicist [Mark Oliphant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark%5FOliphant) because, as enemy aliens in Britain, they are ineligible to participate in secret war work—issue the Frisch-Peierls memorandum. It contradicts the common thinking of the time that many tons of uranium would be needed to make a bomb, requiring delivery by ship. The calculation in the memorandum shows that a bomb might be possible using as little as 1–10 kilograms of pure uranium-235, which would be quite practical for aircraft to carry.

[William Guy Huffman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13590056/william-guy-huffman) of the Red Star Baptist Church in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, is summoned to an apparent airplane crash one Saturday. When he arrives at the scene, about 15 miles from town, he finds a weird-looking craft “broken and scattered all around,” but smooth and rounded without edges or seams. A cockpit with a chair facing an instrument panel remains intact. Police officers, military men, and plain-clothes individuals are sifting through the wreckage. He also sees three non-human bodies about 4 feet tall with long arms, oversized heads, and large eyes. He says a prayer for them, and afterward sees someone take a photo of an alien propped up by the arms between two plainclothesmen. The following evening, he is given a copy of the photo by a member of his congregation \(thought to be [Garland D. Fronabarger](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/15533576/garland-d-fronabarger)\), but he loans it later to someone who never returns it. Huffman’s wife [Floy](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/27616322/floy-m%5F-huffman) reveals the story to her granddaughter, Charlette Mann, on her deathbed in 1984, who relates the story to ufologist [Leonard Stringfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard%5FH.%5FStringfield).

**Description:** The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service upon the United States against the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, just before 8:00 a.m. (local time) on Sunday. The United States was a neutral country at the time; the attack led to its formal entry into World War II on the side of the Allies the next day. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI and as Operation Z during its planning. (Author Moira McGhee wrote in her book "Alien Gene" that the Pearl Harbor attacks were being observed by one or more UFO's.)

**Description:** With the US at war, funding for an atomic bomb is now available in amounts undreamed of the year before. At the S-1 Section meeting, American physicist [Ernest Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest%5FLawrence) asks for $400,000 for electromagnetic separation, and the section immediately recommends granting it. MIT physicist [Karl Taylor Compton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl%5FTaylor%5FCompton) is allocated $340,000 for nuclear reactor research at Columbia and Princeton, and $278,000 at the University of Chicago. Another $500,000 is earmarked for raw materials. His proposed schedule is no less breathtaking: to produce a nuclear chain reaction by July 1942, and an atomic bomb by January 1945. In January 1942, he creates the Metallurgical Laboratory, centralizing the work at the University of Chicago.

**Date:** 2/24/1942  
**End date:** 2/25/1942  
**Locations:** Los Angeles, California; Los Angeles County; Pacific coast; Southern California  
**Description:** The Battle of Los Angeles takes place, a rumored enemy attack and subsequent anti-aircraft barrage over Los Angeles, California. Air raid sirens sound throughout Los Angeles County on the night of February 24. A total blackout is ordered, and thousands of air raid wardens are summoned to their positions. At 3:16 a.m., the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade begins firing .50 caliber machine guns and 12.8-pound anti-aircraft shells into the air at reported aircraft; more than 1,400 shells are eventually fired. Pilots of the 4th Interceptor Command are alerted, but their aircraft remain grounded. The artillery fire continues sporadically until 4:14 a.m. The “all clear” is sounded and the blackout order lifted at 7:21 a.m. Several buildings and vehicles are damaged by shell fragments, and five civilians die as an indirect result of the anti-aircraft fire. Three are killed in car accidents in the ensuing chaos and two die of heart attacks attributed to the stress of the hour-long action. The incident is front-page news along the Pacific coast and earns some mass media coverage. Within hours of the end of the air raid, Secretary of the Navy [Frank Knox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%5FKnox) holds a press conference, saying the entire incident was a false alarm due to anxiety and “war nerves.” Knox’s comments are followed by statements from the Army on February 26 that reflect General [George C. Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%5FMarshall)’s belief that the incident was caused by commercial airplanes used as a psychological warfare campaign to generate panic. Some contemporary press outlets suspect a cover-up. Rep. [Leland M. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland%5FM.%5FFord) \(R-Calif.\) calls for a congressional investigation, saying, “none of the explanations so far offered removed the episode from the category of ‘complete mystification’ ... this was either a practice raid, or a raid to throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to lay a political foundation to take away Southern California’s war industries.” The Japanese government, after the war ended, declares that they had flown no airplanes over Los Angeles during the war. In 1983, the US Office of Air Force History attributes the event to a case of “war nerves” triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries. A number of fake documents about this incident have been circulated by [Timothy S. Cooper](https://majesticdocuments.waskosky.com/about/investigation-team/timothy-s-cooper/).

### <a name="D99105DF"></a> Event 1391 (D99105DF)
**Date:** 2/25/1942  
**Description:** At around 2:30 a.m. on this night in Los Angeles County, California a formation of 6-9 luminous white balls of light flying in a triangular formation flew in from the northwest, moving very slowly. They also appeared as steady radar blips coming in from the sea. As they flew over aircraft factories and this was shortly after the United States entry into World War II, widespread panic resulted, and five people were killed by the anti-aircraft fire hitting the ground and in subsequent traffic accidents. In the evening in Santa Monica, California a white disc was sighted hovering high in the sky.

**Locations:** Tasman Peninsula, Tasmania; Bass Strait  
**Description:** 5:50 p.m. An RAAF pilot is on flying patrol off the Tasman Peninsula, Tasmania, following reports by fishermen of strange lights on the waters of Bass Strait. A “singular airfoil of glistening bronze color” appears out of a cloudbank. It’s about 150 feet long, 50 feet in diameter, and has a dome on top. It accompanies his plane for a few minutes before departing at “a hell of a pace.” It turns again and dives into the ocean, throwing up a “whirlpool of waves.”

**Date:** 6/25/1942  
**Alternate date:** 3/25/1942  
**Locations:** Ruhr Valley, Germany; Zuiderzee in Holland  
**Description:** Midnight. Flight Lt. Roman \(Ray\) Sabiński of the 301 Polish Bomber Squadron is flying an RAF Wellington bomber after returning from a run on the Ruhr Valley, Germany; he sees a bright copper-colored light the “size of the moon” following the aircraft over the Zuiderzee in Holland. When it gets within 200 yards, the rear gunner shoots at it with all four machine guns. After two minutes, it moves at terrific speed to the port side, and the front gunner starts firing at it. Sabiński takes evasive action, but the object keeps pacing him. Finally, it moves in front of the bomber, stays there a while, then takes off at fantastic speed.

The Navy destroyer [USS Helm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FHelm%5F%28DD-388%29) is on its way to the Solomon Islands in preparation for the Guadalcanal landings. A radio blackout is in effect. An aircraft approaches, a full alert is sounded, and three cruisers \([Vincennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FVincennes%5F%28CA-44%29)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FVincennes%5F%28CA-44%29) [Quincy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FQuincy%5F%28CA-39%29)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FQuincy%5F%28CA-39%29) [Astoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FAstoria%5F%28CA-34%29)\) and seven other ships open fire on it. The object is not hit and proceeds to circle around the fleet. An anonymous sailor on security detail on the Helm watches it through binoculars and sees it as 90 feet in diameter, oval, with a round dome on top. The ships continue to fire on the UFO, which attains extremely high speeds. Commanding Officer [Chester Edward Carroll](http://abbot.us/captains/carroll.shtml) later hears that the aircraft is neither German nor Japanese.

**Date:** Late 1942?  
**Location:** Europe  
**Description:** According to records released in August 2010, Prime Minister [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston%5FChurchill) supposedly classifies for 50 years an alleged UFO incident because of fears it could create mass panic. The incident allegedly involves an RAF reconnaissance plane returning from a mission in Europe. The aircraft is over or near the English coastline when it is allegedly intercepted by a strange metallic object that matches the aircraft’s course and speed for a time before shooting away. The plane’s crew photograph the object, which “hovered noiselessly” near the aircraft before moving off. According to the documents, details of the cover-up emerge when a man writes to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the incident. He describes how his grandfather, who served with the RAF, was present when Churchill and Gen. [Dwight Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight%5FD.%5FEisenhower) discussed how to deal with the encounter. However, the evidence is hearsay and somewhat questionable.

**Description:** THEY FOLLOW THE LEADER - Mrs. A.M. Strickler, while out walking between 9 and 10pm, sighted in the sky over the Susquehanna Bridge, on Route 30, a string of highly illuminated objects which, she says she can best describe as being similar to a train of passenger coaches, seeming to weave in and out in a highly specialized follow-the-leader pattern. Illumination seemed to emanate from an endless string of portholes which were arranged on a straight line or plane and were yellowish like an incandescent bulb. The objects were cigar-shaped, but could have been one side of a flat, saucer-shaped form. Each "coach" was identical in size and shape except the first, which was larger, brighter and seemed to have a proboscis-shaped appendage in front like a figure head. The objects traveled extremely fast, emitting no noise, jet exhaust, or flame.

**Description:** 8:00 p.m. RAAF Lt. [Bruce Clyde Lumsden](https://stalag45.rssing.com/chan-58806349/article11-live.html) is flying a Hawker Hurricane heading for the French coast. About 7,000 feet over the mouth of the River Somme, France, he observes two orange lights climbing, one slightly above the other. He completes a full turn, putting the lights behind him on the port side. They now appear brighter and larger. When they reach his altitude, they stop climbing and stay at his altitude. He makes another full turn, but the objects stay with him. Lumsden dives to 4,000 feet, but the lights match his maneuvers. He increases his speed to 260 mph and gradually leaves them behind. His squadron mates do not believe him, but the next night another squadron member has a similar encounter with a green light.

**Date:** 1943  
**Location:** San Diego, CA  
**Description:** SAUCERS GIVE NAVAL GUNS THE BRUSHOFF - In conversing with a former Navy man who is presently a radio technician for the Santa Fe railroad, he related that sometime in 1943 while he was stationed at San Diego and assigned to a gun crew on a naval destroyer they were alerted to their stations. Shortly five saucers (such as those pictured by George Adamski) appeared over the ship and hovered. Orders were given to fire upon them. He asserted that they could see the tracers and shells heading directly toward the saucers. The shells either exploded or disintegrated before reaching the objects. This attack continued for 10 minutes but nothing affected them. At the approach of naval planes the saucers disappeared.

**Date:** 7/18/1943  
**Locations:** Gdynia, Poland; Baltic Sea  
**Description:** A French prisoner in a German labor camp near Gdynia, Poland, is walking to work along the Baltic Sea when he sees a flat, metallic object embedded in the sand. A human figure is standing next to it, apparently trying to dig it up. When he passes by, the figure, apparently an Asian woman with long blonde hair and dressed in a tight- fitting overall, turns in his direction. The witness assumes she is the famous German aviator [Hanna Reitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna%5FReitsch) and helps her dig the experimental aircraft out of the sand. The object is 20 feet in diameter and looks like two metallic saucers put together. The woman touches the witness’s chest with her hand and points to the sky. She touches her belt and a door in the object opens. She crawls inside, the door closes, and the object ascends and departs at a tremendous speed.

**Date:** 10/14/1943  
**Location:** Germany  
**Description:** Night. A group of B-17s from the 384th Bombardment Group are returning from a mission over Germany when they see a cluster of silver-colored discs in the path of their formation and closing with the bombers. The crews talk back and forth, discussing and confirming the sight before them. They describe the objects as “about one inch thick and three inches in diameter…gliding down slowly in a very uniform cluster.” One of the bombers goes directly through the cluster “with absolutely no effect on engines or plane surface,” even though one is heard to strike the tail assembly. A mass of black debris about 3-4 feet long is also observed.

### <a name="EE73B27A"></a> Event 1541 (EE73B27A)
**Date:** 11/1943  
**Location:** Mantong  
**Description:** [Ray Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond%5FA.%5FPalmer) publishes an article, “An Ancient Language?” on the language of Mantong in the January 1944 issue of Amazing Stories and enters into correspondence with [Richard S. Shaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%5FSharpe%5FShaver), who responds with a 10,000- word document titled “A Warning to Future Man.” Shaver writes of advanced prehistoric races who built underground cities before abandoning Earth for another planet because of damaging radiation from the Sun. Those ancients also abandoned some of their own offspring here, a minority of whom remained noble and human “Teros,” while most degenerate over time into a population of mentally impaired sadists known as “Deros”— short for “detrimental robots.” Shaver’s robots are not mechanical constructs, but robot-like due to their savage behavior. These Deros still live in the cave cities, according to Shaver, kidnapping surface-dwelling people by the thousands for meat or torture. Deros can be blamed for nearly all misfortunes, from minor “accidental” injuries or illnesses to airplane crashes and catastrophic natural disasters. Though generally confined to their caves, the Deros sometimes travel in spaceships or rockets, and have dealings with equally evil extraterrestrials. Shaver claims to possess first-hand knowledge of the Deros and their caves, insisting he had been their prisoner for several years. The article stirs considerable reader interest, and the pages of Amazing Stories are soon filled with stories and articles about the “Shaver mystery.”

### <a name="DC467B86"></a> Event 1549 (DC467B86)
**Date:** 12/2/1943  
**Location:** Bari, Italy  
**Description:** Night. Some 105 German Junkers Ju 888 bombers attack the port of Bari, Italy, a key supply center for Allied forces. 28 Allied ships are sunk, including the US Liberty ship [SS John Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS%5FJohn%5FHarvey)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS%5FJohn%5FHarvey) which is carrying mustard gas intended for retaliation in case German forces use chemical warfare. Liquid sulfur mustard from the bombs spills into waters already contaminated by oil from the other damaged vessels. The many sailors who abandoned their ships into the water become covered with the oily mixture. The wounded are pulled from the water and sent to medical facilities whose personnel are unaware of the mustard gas. Medical staff focus on personnel with blast or fire injuries. Within a day, the first symptoms of mustard poisoning appear in 628 patients and medical staff, including blindness and chemical burns. That puzzling development is further complicated by the arrival of hundreds of Italian civilians also seeking treatment, who have been poisoned by a cloud of sulfur mustard vapor that blows over the city when some of John Harvey’s cargo exploded. As the medical crisis worsens, little information is available about what is causing the symptoms, because US military command want to keep the presence of chemical munitions secret from the Germans. By the end of the month, 83 of the 628 hospitalized military victims have died. The number of civilian casualties, thought to have been even greater, cannot be accurately gauged since most have left the city to seek shelter with relatives.

Wells sets up a roadside café, Palomar Gardens. According to coworker Charlotte Blodget, “Each member of the group shared in the manual labor that went into this effort, and since heavy restrictions were still in effect regarding materials \[in the war’s aftermath\], anything available had to serve.” Adamski builds a “small observatory” to house his 15-inch telescope to study the skies.

McDonald](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/106278/major-general-george-c-mcdonald/) is appointed assistant chief of staff for intelligence for the newly created US Strategic Air Forces in Europe. “Many months preceding the collapse of Germany, McDonald recognized the imperative need for the creation of a new type of intelligence activity to investigate and exploit air intelligence objectives in Germany and liberated countries. This unique system was established and consisted of a great number of highly qualified technical and scientific personnel to exploit all the worldwide aeronautical research developments of Germany. This resulted in the collection of priority intelligence information of value in the prosecution of the war against Japan; technical and non-technical information of immediate operational significance and value; as well as a substantial portion of important documents and personnel of the German Air Ministry that enabled the US Army Air Forces to undertake long-range research with respect to many valuable- phases of air doctrine, research, employment, organization, procedure, and plans of the German air force.” Among the personalities involved in the operation are some who will become involved in UFO investigations in the future: Col.

**Date:** 6/1944  
**Location:** Palmyra Atoll  
**Description:** A Coast Guard ship receives a message that a Navy plane has been lost at sea, and they were requested to join the search. They searched for almost 24 hours and found nothing. The following night, Ed Ludwig (of Stockton, CA) while on watch notices a brilliant, globalar light in the sky that was absolutely silent. It was about three times brighter than the brightest star or planet, and large enough that he made out its roundness. It appeared stationary for a minute or so, then began to move in slow, slight movements. The witness had the feeling they were being watched, as if the ball was observing the island. It covered an area of the sky approx. 100 degrees. It speeded up and traveled away from the island towards the direction where the plane was lost.

### <a name="3DE9B012"></a> Event 1647 (3DE9B012)
**Date:** Late 8/1944  
**Location:** Christchurch, New Zealand  
**Description:** 4:20 p.m. A nurse, Mrs. E. M. Church, on her way to a tram station in Christchurch, New Zealand, sees an object like an “upturned saucer” resting on the ground near the road. It seems to be 20 feet across and 9 feet high. Two beings, not quite 4 feet tall, are inside, visible through a rectangular window. A third stands motionless, just outside an open door. All three seem to be looking toward the lights of a nearby fairground. The nurse cannot decide if their skin color is green or they are dressed in green, but all are encased in a transparent oblong box. The head takes up half of their bodies and there are no apparent legs or arms. She inadvertently makes a noise, and the outside figure notices her. Its helmet flips over automatically, and it drifts inside the object, which rises up and disappears in the clouds.

**Date:** 9/7/1944  
**Location:** Germany  
**Description:** First V-2 rocket attacks begin. Two launched at Paris. V-2’s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of 100–110 km (62–68 mi) at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 3550 km/h). The British government, concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to German forces, initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement, and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains. The public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the V-2s as “flying gas mains”.

The father goes to the door, where he sees a 4.5-foot-tall figure dressed in a brown robe. Fifteen feet to its left are five other figures dressed in luminous brown metallic suits. Their heads seem large, with only a slit for a mouth. The arms are long, with long thin fingers. Three of them enter the house and the father accompanies them to a landed craft nearby. He remembers nothing else when he wakes up in the morning. A round, burned circle 20 feet from the house and 25 feet in diameter is found the next day.

**Description:** Capt. [William D. Leet](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/139829263/william-dean-leet)’s B-17 crew \(part of the 2nd Bombardment Group, 5th Wing of the Fifteenth Air Force\) is returning from bombing a target at Klagenfurt, Austria. While flying over northeastern Italy near Trieste, Leet notices a blinding light and feels an intense heat. It goes away quickly, but seconds later he sees a “round amber light” sitting off the left wingtip of the B-17. It is bright and perfectly circular. Leet orders the gunners not to shoot at it. Sgt. Harris, the upper gunner, thinks it is 10 feet in diameter and 150–300 feet away. The object stays with them over the Adriatic Sea for 50 minutes, until it “just turned off” like a light bulb.

**Description:** Night. Navy Lt. [George Arents III](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/184270993/george-arents) and copilot Lt. Elon Forster are flying a military DC-3 at 9,000 feet between Blackstone and Richmond, Virginia, when they notice a cigar-shaped object hovering below them at about 4,000 feet. It appears to be 200 feet long and has two horizontal rows of blue-lighted windows and a flaming exhaust coming out of its tail. \(Jan Aldrich\) Late December through February 1945 — Radar operators at Naval Air Station Pasco, Washington, report unusual blips that appear out of nowhere and proceed from northwest to southeast. A Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter is scrambled on at least two occasions with orders to shoot down anything that appears to be hostile, but nothing is seen. In another incident, Lt. JG Clarence R. Clem accompanies Lt. Commander Richard Brown and Ensign C. T. Neal to a waiting aircraft and Brown takes off in pursuit of a ball of fire that quickly leaves him behind as it speeds off to the northwest and is lost to radar. On another occasion, naval officer R. W. Hendershot, flying an SNJ aircraft, is asked by ground radar to make contact with two high-altitude blips flying at the speed of a single- engine Piper Cub. Though he can see nothing, he is convinced the blips are real.

**Date:** 2/2/1945  
**Locations:** Oranienburg, Germany; Gotha  
**Description:** The first flight of the H.IX V2 is made in Oranienburg, Germany. All subsequent test flights and development are done by Gothaer Waggonfabrik in Gotha. By this time, the [Horten brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten%5Fbrothers) are working on a turbojet-powered design for the Amerika Bomber contract competition and do not attend the first test flight. The test pilot is Leutnant [Erwin Ziller.](http://www.pilotenbunker.de/Unbek%5FHelden/Ziller%5FErwin/ziller%5Ferwin.htm) Two further test flights are made in February. There are reports that during one of these test flights, the H.IX V2 undertook a simulated dogfight with a Messerschmitt Me 262, the first operational jet fighter, and that the H.IX V2 outperformed the Me 262. However, the Me 262 is considered by many as unsuitable for fighter missions, being slow in turning.

**Date:** 2/10/1945  
**Locations:** Chicago; Washington  
**Description:** The Chicago Tribune and Washington Times-Herald reveal [Bill Donovan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FJ.%5FDonovan)’s plans for a postwar intelligence agency and publishes a secret memo he has sent to [Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%5FD.%5FRoosevelt) proposing its creation. The article compares the proposed agency to the Gestapo. Knowing that Americans want a smaller federal government after the war, Roosevelt is not entirely sold on Donovan’s proposal, although Donovan feels reasonably confident that he can talk the president into the idea. [J. Edgar Hoover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%5FEdgar%5FHoover) disapproves of Donovan’s plan, which he sees as a direct threat to FBI authority, even though Donovan has stressed that his agency will operate only abroad, not domestically.

**Location:** Gotha, Germany  
**Description:** Disaster strikes during the third test flight of the H.IX V2 in Gotha, Germany. [Erwin Ziller](http://www.pilotenbunker.de/Unbek%5FHelden/Ziller%5FErwin/ziller%5Ferwin.htm) takes off without any problems to perform a series of flight tests. After about 45 minutes, at an altitude of around 800 meters, one of the Jumo 004 turbojet engines develops a problem, catches fire and stops. Ziller is seen putting the aircraft into a dive and pulling up several times in an attempt to restart the engine and save the precious prototype. He undertakes a series of four complete turns at a 20° angle. Ziller does not use his radio or eject from the aircraft. He already is unconscious as a result of the fumes from the burning engine. The aircraft crashes just outside the boundary of the airfield. Ziller is thrown from the aircraft on impact and dies from his injuries two weeks later. The prototype aircraft is completely destroyed.

**Date:** 3/1945  
**Location:** wooded area near Belfast, Maine  
**Description:** A man is squirrel hunting in a wooded area near Belfast, Maine, when he sees a huge, elongated object just above the trees. He runs after it, thinking it is a dirigible about to crash. The object crashes into the trees at the far edge of a clearing, splitting a huge pine tree down the middle. He smells burned rubber. The object seems to be as big as several B-36 bombers. As he stands there stunned, the lowest end of the craft begins to rise and he hears a humming sound of increasing intensity. After it rises to a horizontal position, it begins to spin faster and faster and the hum becomes very intense. Suddenly one end spews a shower of fine, silvery threads that glint in the sunlight. The object begins to change to a white metallic color and it takes off straight up at fantastic speed.

### <a name="97671209"></a> Event 1834 (97671209)
**Date:** 4/1945  
**Locations:** Okinawa, Japan; Ryukyu Islands  
**Description:** During operations around Okinawa, Japan, the radar crew on the aircraft carrier [USS Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS%5FIndependence%5F%28CVL-22%29) frequently notices strange radar returns that move at slow speeds \(30–70 mph\). Aircraft and destroyers sent to search for them never find anything. These radar ghosts are usually detected 25–30 miles away at an altitude of 1,500 feet, but occasionally 3,500 feet. The primary diagnostic for these false returns is their speed. The Navy nicknames them the “ghost of Nansei-shoto” after the Japanese name for the Ryukyu Islands, of which Okinawa is one.

**Date:** 4/18/1945  
**Description:** There were two radar-visual UFO reports on this day from the Far East near Iwo Jima. At three o'clock in the morning ground control radar made radar contact with an unknown radar target over the Pacific Ocean at a distance of 18 to 8 miles from the island. The gunner in a P-61B "Black Widow" aircraft attached to the 549th NFS squadron saw a yellow, star-like light approach and lose altitude. Radar contact was then lost. The gunner saw a second light, but no radar contact was made with it. At 4:15 a.m. Ground control again made radar contact with a target. The gunner of a P-61B plane saw a reddish, round light. Contact on the radar screen showed two blips engaging in evasive action, which soon outdistanced the P-61, one of the fastest propeller driven aircraft of its time.

He thinks it could be as much as 4–5 miles wide. It moves vertically and is gone in an instant. Suddenly his aircraft loses its electrical power and loses one of its bombs. He and his bomber and engineer get severe headaches. They return to base in England after regaining power.

It looks like Venus but has a yellow color. She gets off the bus and still watches it, walking home. Soon she sees it is moving slowly to the northwest. She gets her mother to view it as well. Druffel thinks it is too high to be a coastal defense balloon. Druffel watches it for 90 minutes, after which it takes on some “activity.” Some 10–15 pieces of light begin separating from it, fading from view after moving several diameters away from the large object.

**Date:** 7/1945  
**Locations:** Tinian; Northern Marianas; Japan; Iwo Jima  
**Description:** The 9th Bombardment Group on Tinian in the Northern Marianas: “During our night missions in June and July a UFO phenomenon was reported. Our air crews started sighting balls of fire, i.e., glowing objects about the size of a full moon which flew around in the vicinity of our flying patterns over Japan. One of our crews reported that one of the objects followed their airplane halfway to Iwo Jima. I saw them on two missions. I don’t remember any reports of any hostile action by these objects and the reports of sightings stopped after a couple of months. The object of these reports was dismissed by some experts as the planet Venus. And, after these reports started coming in, some crews did mistake the rising full moon as one of these balls of fire. Some reports speculated that these balls of fire were exhausts from a Japanese development called a Baka Bomb, but exhaust flames can only be seen from the rear; and these objects appeared to have the same size and intensity in whatever direction they were traveling. I have never heard of any official assessment as to what these objects were. I had an occasion to ask General [LeMay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis%5FLeMay) about them several years after the war and he had no explanation.

This marks the beginning of Sandia Base \[now part of Kirtland AFB\]. Nearby Kirtland Field is used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests. By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover are transferred to Sandia. As reservist officers are demobilized, they are replaced by about 50 hand- picked regular officers.

### <a name="91ADF844"></a> Event 1950 (91ADF844)
**Date:** 12/5/1945  
**Locations:** Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Atlantic Ocean; Florida Keys; off the coast of Florida  
**Description:** A training flight \(Flight 19\) of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers disappears while over the Atlantic Ocean. The squadron’s flight plan is scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for 141 miles, north for 73 miles, and then back over a final 140-mile leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returns to base. A report by Navy investigators concludes that flight leader Lt. [Charles C. Taylor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7071436/charles-carroll-taylor) mistook small islands offshore for the Florida Keys after his compasses stopped working, resulting in the flight heading over open sea and away from land. The report is later amended by the Navy to read “cause unknown” to avoid blaming Taylor for the loss of five aircraft and 14 men. One of the search-and-rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, also disappears. The report attributes the loss of the PBM aircraft to an explosion in midair while searching for the flight. According to contemporaneous sources, the Mariner has a history of explosions due to vapor leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation. A tanker off the coast of Florida sees an explosion and a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather is becoming stormy by the end of the incident. None of the Avenger bombers have been found.

### <a name="503FD69F"></a> Event 1962 (503FD69F)
**Date:** 1946  
**Locations:** Westerham, Kent, England; Croydon  
**Description:** A farmer named Gunyon in Westerham, Kent, England, calls the British Technical Intelligence staff asking that the Air Ministry come and remove one of these “darned contraptions” which has fallen on his farm. The intelligence officers ask for directions and are told to drive from Croydon to Westerham, turning onto a lane when they reach a pub called The White Dog. Amid great security, two staff cars are dispatched, but fail to find the farm. They locate a pub called The White Hart and a farmer named Bunyan, who strenuously denies having made the call. Although the incident appears to be a hoax, few people can reach the Technical Intelligence staff and convince them to make a field visit. Indeed, the intelligence officers believe that former Air Intelligence scientist [Reginald Victor Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald%5FVictor%5FJones), who has been skeptical of foo fighters and ghost rockets, is behind the affair. Jones writes that a signal is received from Gen. [Douglas MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas%5FMacArthur)’s staff in Tokyo, asking for confirmation of a report that a Russian flying bomb had recently crashed in England. The other Director of Intelligence on the Air Staff, Air Commodore Roland Eugene Vintras, suggests to Jones that this might tie in with the “Westerham Incident.”

**Date:** 5/18/1946  
**Locations:** Kronoskagen; Ängelholm, Sweden  
**Description:** 10:45 p.m. [Gösta Carlsson](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sta%5FCarlsson%5F%28f%C3%B6retagare%29)[,](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sta%5FCarlsson%5F%28f%C3%B6retagare%29) later to become founder and owner of Cernelle AB, is walking in the forested area of Kronoskagen near Ängelholm, Sweden, when he sees a disc-shaped machine more than 50 feet in diameter. On the top is a cupola with oval windows, and beneath it are an oblong “fan,” two legs, a small ladder, and openings. A man dressed in a white, one-piece outfit gestures to Carlsson to stop. Two other occupants, three of them women, all wearing suits and transparent helmets, are nearby. One of the males points a boxlike device at the witness, who leaves the scene but returns by a different route 30 minutes later, just in time to see the UFO depart. A concrete model of the UFO is dedicated in 1963 as a memorial.

**Date:** 7/10/1946  
**Locations:** Norrvikssand, Sweden; Kubikenborg  
**Description:** A brilliantly glowing projectile trailing luminous smoke crashes into a beach near Norrvikssand, Sweden. Airline pilot Torvald Linden and other witnesses find a shallow crater a little more than 3 feet in diameter. A mass of slag-like material, some of it reduced to powder \(which burns the hands when touched\) is found at the site and collected into bags. A journalist from Svenska Dagbladet on July 11 finds a “burnt-brown object with a hollow cylinder” with a diameter of about 1–2 inches. Military authorities take over the site. The debris is taken to Dr. B. Backlund at a laboratory in Kubikenborg, who finds it contains paper with microscopic black-and-white squares like a screen. Some porous, rust-colored fragments are also present. The same day, the beach is visited by Lt. Col. [Rudberg](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik%5FRudberg%5F%28milit%C3%A4r%29), Capt. C. Ljungdahl, and Capt. R. Westlin, who conclude that the material has been in the area for a long time.

**Description:** 11:30 a.m. Kurt Larsson, 11, is fishing at the north end of Lake Kattisträsket, Sweden, when he hears a roaring sound.

**Date:** 7/19/1946  
**Location:** Lake Kölmjärv, Sweden  
**Description:** 11:45 a.m. Many witnesses see a gray, winged rocket crash into Lake Kölmjärv, Sweden, with a loud bang close to the southwest bank. Knut Lindbäck says it generates a high plume of water when it hits the surface, “followed by another cascade as if something had detonated.” Water lilies and other aquatic plants are torn up and thrown on the shore. Lieut. Karl-Gösta Bartoll from the Boden engineer corps arrives the next day to supervise the salvage operation. Engineers Roland Rynniger and lab technician Torsten Wilner from the Defense Research Department also arrive with a Geiger counter. A three-week search turns up no traces of metal, even though the evidence points to an underwater explosion.

In addition, a document containing Restricted Data can also contain Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information. In this way, a document can be classified as Secret \(S\), Secret//Restricted Data \(S//RD\), or Secret//Restricted Data- Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information \(S//RD-CNWDI\), depending on the type of information it contains.

Sometimes two of the objects are seen flying together. Some witnesses see smaller silver balls come out of the larger objects, which are variously described as cylinders and torpedoes with a “wide nose” and “fire-spurting tail.” Stockholm is said to be “near the boiling point” with ghost rocket speculation.

Chamberlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%5FJ.%5FChamberlin)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%5FJ.%5FChamberlin) Army assistant chief of staff for intelligence, to ask Budapest for further information. Top-secret requests are sent to military attachés in London, Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki, and Copenhagen asking for listings of all ghost rocket reports, as well as V-3 and V-4 missiles. The military attaché in Oslo reports that a Soviet ship in the north Baltic Sea has been transmitting code to shore stations regarding the ghost rockets. The military attaché in Moscow asks other European officials about where the rockets originate and gets several answers, which he forwards on to Chamberlin: Hiiumaa island, Estonia; Latvia; or Peenemünde, Germany. Gen. [Joseph T. McNarney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%5FT.%5FMcNarney) of the US Forces in Europe Theater replies that Peenemünde is a likely origin, since the site has been refurbished. The military attaché in Stockholm suspects Hiiumaa, Peenemünde, or Parikkala in Finland, while the naval attaché in Stockholm thinks that Łeba, Poland, is the launch site.

### <a name="944A94E1"></a> Event 2145 (944A94E1)
**Date:** 8/19/1946  
**Locations:** US; Stockholm, Sweden; Europe; London; Sweden  
**Description:** Two US experts on aerial warfare, aviation legend General [Jimmy Doolittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy%5FDoolittle) and British Group Captain [Douglas Bader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas%5FBader)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas%5FBader) and General [David Sarnoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FSarnoff)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FSarnoff) president of RCA, arrive in Stockholm, Sweden, ostensibly on private business, and independently of each other. The official explanation is that Doolittle, who is now vice-president of the Shell Oil Company, is inspecting Shell branch offices in Europe, while Sarnoff, a former member of General [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight%5FD.%5FEisenhower)’s London staff, is studying the market for radio equipment. However, the story indicates that the Chief of the Swedish Defense Staff, Col. C. R. Kempf, makes no secret that he “was extremely interested in asking the two generals advice and, if possible, would place all available reports before them.” However, Doolittle denies the correlation to [Barry Greenwood](http://www.noufors.com/Barry%5FJ%5FGreenwood.htm) in 1984, and researchers have found no evidence to support a collaboration.

It takes the daytime reports seriously but concludes are probably only a few genuine reports of actual missiles.

McCage says it is as big as a football field, has windows, and is making a loud noise. A yellowish- blue-green flame is shooting out near the back, and it is traveling too fast for any plane at the time.

**Date:** 1/17/1947  
**Locations:** Neatishead, northeast of Norwich, England; North Sea  
**Description:** 11:37 p.m. After two unidentified targets similar to yesterday’s are reported by RAF Neatishead, northeast of Norwich, England, over the North Sea, another radar track enters the Eastern Sector area, and an RAF Mosquito piloted by Flight Lt. William Kent is scrambled to 18,000 feet. Kent attempts to close in, but his onboard radar is unable to keep it on track because the target is “jerking violently” and taking evasive action. After 20 minutes, the target descends below 2,000 feet and is lost from ground radar. Unofficially the radar operators give the intruder a name—Charlie—and when the Air Ministry later begins a concerted effort to solve the mystery, its code name is “Operation Charlie.”

**Description:** Capt. J. B. Pearson Jr., US naval attaché in London, England, sends an intelligence report to the Chief of Naval Intelligence about his conversation with Col. Westergard, head of the Airplane Design Section for the Swedish Air Ministry. Westergard tells him some 40% of the 1,000 ghost rocket sightings are “reliable.” They seem to originate in Peenemünde, Germany, and fly toward Finland. The best observation is from an artillery officer who sees an object in his optical range finder and follows it for about 90 seconds. It is in level flight at 4.5 miles distance and is about 36 feet long and torpedo shaped.

**Date:** Late 4/1947  
**Alternate date:** Early 5/1947  
**Location:** Tucson, Arizona  
**Description:** 12:05 p.m. Mrs. William Down and Mrs. H. G. Olavick of Tucson, Arizona, see an unusual, fleecy cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky. Moving around it in “yo-yo fashion” are a number of small discs with a dull-white finish. They move up and down and sideways, occasionally disappearing into or behind the cloud. They watch the objects for 5–7 minutes, then all the discs disappear above the cloud, while a larger object emerges from the cloud and moves eastward. Behind it comes a V-formation of nine of the smaller discs, which then climbs at high speed toward the northeast and disappears in 2–3 seconds. The witnesses assume the objects are some new type of aircraft.

**Locations:** Yale University; Hartford, Connecticut  
**Description:** Evening. Yale University astrophysicist [Lyman Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman%5FSpitzer) is speaking on WTIC radio in Hartford, Connecticut, and speculates that if life on Mars developed a bit earlier than on earth, it is possible that Martians have been civilized for millions of years. “Unless they had spent some time in a large city or had landed sufficiently recently to be photographed, we would have no record of their being here,” he says, and that “any few men who had seen them would probably not be believed by anyone else.”

**Location:** Joliet, Illinois  
**Description:** 1:50 p.m. Railroad engineer Charles Kastl sees 9 or 10 spinning discs in the air about 12 miles east of Joliet, Illinois. They are a string of flat circular objects “going faster than anything I’ve ever seen.” Kastl can see no connecting link between them, but they act as though the leading disc has a motor in it to power the others, because when it flips, the others do as well. When it rights itself, the others also right themselves.

### <a name="8A22ECD2"></a> Event 2398 (8A22ECD2)
**Date:** 6/24/1947  
**Locations:** Boise, Idaho; Chehalis, Washington; Yakima, Washington; Mount Rainier, Washington; Mount Adams, Washington; Pendleton, Oregon  
**Description:** 3:00 p.m. Boise, Idaho, businessman [Kenneth Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth%5FArnold), flying his CallAir Model A-2 from Chehalis to Yakima, Washington, sees a string of nine objects flying in an echelon formation past Mount Rainier, Washington. At first he assumes they are jets, but he can see no trails. They cover the 50-mile distance between Rainier and another peak in 1 minute 42 seconds. He estimates their speed to be at least 1,200 mph. The objects swerve in and out of the smaller peaks, flipping from side to side in unison, dipping, and presenting their lateral surfaces, which reflect the bright sunlight and cause the flashes he saw earlier. They are in view for about two and a half minutes and are last seen heading south over the last high peak of Mount Adams. Arnold tells the airport staff about it in Yakima at 4:00 p.m. and they call ahead to Pendleton, Oregon, to alert them of Arnold’s arrival at an air show and his story. A large crowd awaits him, and a discussion follows. The consensus is that Arnold has seen guided missiles. But no such technology exists at the time that can match the objects’ description and performance, and the late 1990s explanation that Arnold observed a flight of white pelicans is equally improbable. Researcher [Martin](http://www.cufos.org/shough.html) [Shough](http://www.cufos.org/shough.html) concludes in 2010: “Examination of the sighting report in detail improves its evident internal consistency, rather than degrading it, and study of the principal contending explanations reveals that they are each very much less attractive when tried out in quantitative detail against the best information than they may appear at first sight.”

**Date:** 6/24/1947  
**Location:** Mount Adams, Oregon  
**Description:** Afternoon. Fred M. Johnson, a prospector in the Mount Adams, Oregon, area, sees 5-6 oval objects with tails about 30 feet in diameter. He watches one through a telescope. They are not flying in any sort of formation and as they bank in a turn, the sunlight flashes off them. As they approach, Johnson notices that his compass begins to spin wildly. When the objects finally vanish in the distance, the compass returns to normal. Johnson’s report is the very first “unidentified” case in the Project Sign files.

### <a name="4DC73B4B"></a> Event 2402 (4DC73B4B)
**Date:** 6/24/1947  
**Description:** At 2:58 p.m. Kenneth Arnold, flying his private plane near Mount Rainier, Washington was attracted by reflected sunlight from nine distant metallic flying objects. He watched as they flashed across the sky, one behind the other, "skipping as saucers upon water." They tilted back and forth as they flew. One object was definitely crescent shaped, the others may have been disc shaped or crescent shaped with a 10 to 1 width to thickness ratio. He clocked them as they flew past Mount Adams, and calculated that they were flying at a speed of 1,500 miles per hour and at an altitude of 9,500 feet. When he landed in Pendleton, Oregon he was interviewed at the local radio station where the term "flying saucer" was first coined, despite the fact that the objects he sighted may not have been discs.

I wonder what my wife back in Idaho thinks.”

### <a name="A64C4884"></a> Event 2501 (A64C4884)
**Date:** 7/1/1947  
**Locations:** Roswell Army Air Field, Roswell NM; White Sands, NM  
**Description:** Military officials, both officers and the enlisted technicians had been tracking, on their radar, an unidentified object in flight over southern New Mexico since July 1. The object had first appeared over the highly restricted areas near the White Sands Proving Grounds. On July 2, Steve MacKenzie (a pseudonym, actually Frank Kaufmann), stationed at [Roswell Army Air Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Air_Force_Base), had received a call from [Brigadier General Martin F. Scanlon](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/105707/brigadier-general-martin-f-scanlon/) of the [Air Defense Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Defense_Command), ordering him to report to the radar sites at [White Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range). MacKenzie was to monitor the object's movements and report them directly to the general. MacKenzie could not leave the scope unattended for even the shortest of times. In fact, once he had his watch established, he set up a system of mirrors so that he could see the screen even when he needed to use the latrine. MacKenzie stayed at his post for twenty-four hours straight, but nothing changed. The object appeared periodically over southern New Mexico, but usually just "flitting from one location to another." When MacKenzie reported that nothing had changed significantly during his twenty-four-hour watch, Scanlon decided to end MacKenzie's part of the operation. Although MacKenzie was ordered back to Roswell, the operators at White Sands were told to continue to monitor the object, as were the radarmen at Roswell and Albuquerque. (R.G.: Interestingly, this case was deleted and "declared a hoax" in NICAP's records and by K. Randle, but after re-reading all the relevant research I don't believe at all that this is a matter of a simple hoax. It fits into the historical timeline well and should be re-examined.)

**Description:** 11:00 p.m. Mrs. A. M. King is with another passenger on the deck of the Union-Castle Mail [SS Llandovery](http://www.polishresettlementcampsintheuk.co.uk/passengerlist/otherships.htm) [Castle](http://www.polishresettlementcampsintheuk.co.uk/passengerlist/otherships.htm) as it is steaming through the Mozambique Channel. They notice a star-like object traveling fast toward the ship. It shines a strong beam of light on the water within 150 feet of the ship, then descends, the beam shortening and becoming brighter as it nears the water. Soon the light switches off and they can see a metallic object that looks like a cigar with the end cut off. It remains about 20 feet above the sea, moving parallel with the ship. King estimates it is about four times the length of the ship and four times as tall. After a few seconds, a large flame erupts from the rear of the object. It vanishes soundlessly in the darkness.

**Description:** According to [Annie Jacobsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie%5FJacobsen)’s informant, EG&G engineer [Alfred O’Donnell](https://obituaries.reviewjournal.com/obituary/alfred-o-donnell-1082038666), the upcoming Roswell, New Mexico, crashes are the result of a psychological warfare operation by Soviet leader [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%5FStalin) to fly into US airspace two disc- or wing-shaped aircraft based on a [Horton brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten%5Fbrothers) design obtained at the end of World War II. One craft allegedly contains living dwarves or children \(human guinea pigs\) who had been surgically altered using similar methods to those used in Auschwitz concentration camp by Nazi doctor [Josef Mengele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef%5FMengele). This aircraft is remotely controlled by the crew of the second craft. The idea is to land the first aircraft in a visible location in the US, perhaps in Washington, D.C. The children would exit the craft and present themselves to the highest echelons of the government. However, the two aircraft crash in the New Mexico desert and, he claims, the Atomic Energy Commission is put in charge of the remains.

**Date:** 7/3/1947  
**Location:** San Francisco, CA  
**Description:** The first instance of the ET hypothesis to appear in the media, in a letter by [Ole Johannes Sneide 1886-8/31/1947](https://www.jasoncolavito.com/saucer-mystery-solved.html). His letter first appeared in the *San Francisco Chronicle*. The flying discs were “oblate spheroid space ships from the older planets.” “Usually they travel in outer space with speeds approximating that of light by use of anti-gravity devices and hyperspace. In our space they travel much slower, and, of course, become visible either by intent or by accident, for in their travels they use the invisibility screen.” “This space navigation has been going on for millions of years, these ‘nova’ having come into our galaxy originally from the Great Magellanic Cloud via the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, 47 Tucanae, Omega and Alpha Centauri clusters.” “Their masters planted the original humanities here and which did not develop sui generis. They have been absent from our planet since before the fall of the Roman Empire when the Great Master left earth for the outer galaxy by fohatic teleportation.” “He is now back and what is going to be done depends upon mankind, but my advice is that physical man set up no belligerence, for a small concentration of those disks just beyond the range of our atmosphere could clean the surface of our planet completely in a matter of less than 24 hours. “Their present local headquarters is on the unseen side of our moon. I discovered this by teleportation visits hither and yon in and between our galaxy.” “Mankind,” he concluded, “will just have to learn their physics all over again, someday, if they live. Ah! If they live!”

**Locations:** St. Louis; Wright Field, Ohio; Wright Field  
**Description:** The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the Air Research Center at Wright Field, Ohio, and the army intelligence service are looking into the flying discs. An INS dispatch states that Commander of the Army Air Force Gen. [Carl Spaatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl%5FSpaatz) has asked Wright Field to look into such reports. Air Materiel Command’s Lt. Gen. [Nathan F. Twining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan%5FFarragut%5FTwining) tells Idaho Evening Statesman reporter [David N. Johnson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/39757884/david-n%5F-johnson) that officials are indeed looking into the discs and that Wright Field has no comparable technology. Lieut. [William C. Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FCharles%5FAnderson), Wright Field public relations officer, says there is no confirmation that the discs exist. Maj. [Paul Gaynor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81697834/paul-f-gaynor) says the Army Air Force needs more concrete information. German scientists working at Wright Field are asked about the discs, but they say they have heard nothing about any such experiments in Europe.

**Description:** 6:30 p.m. Mrs. Walter Johnson and her family see 8–9 discs flying out of the southern sky 6 miles west of Saint Maries, Idaho, over the St. Joe River. The objects came in “very fast, slow down jerkily, then flutter to the ground like leaves.” Mrs. Johnson thinks the objects are about the size of a “five-room house.” When they reach a clearing in the timber, they appear to “settle Down” a few at a time. Mrs. Johnson reports the sighting to intelligence officers at the Spokane Army Air Base \[now Fairchild AFB\], and an intensive air search is carried out by two missions of the National Guard’s 116th Fighter Group. Local sheriff’s deputies also make a ground search, but no traces of alanding can be found.

**Date:** 7/3/1947  
**Description:** Harborside, Maine - John F. Cole, an astronomer, watched a series of objects that gave off a roaring noise at 2:30 in the afternoon from Harborside, south of Brooksville, Maine. The objects were in the north and were proceeding northwest at a high speed. He estimated their diameter at 100 feet. Calling the report an "unusually well-supported incident," the Air Force had no explanation. However, years later the Air Materiel Command publicly explained the event as "birds or insects". This sighting was also one of the 1947 cases investigated by the FBI.

**Date:** 7/4/1947  
**Location:** San Francisco, California  
**Description:** The United Press service rounds up theories about the flying discs. It quotes Army Air Force “experts” saying that the sightings might be caused by weather conditions, or meteorites, or foreign aircraft that it is “our responsibility to know about it and take proper action.” Occultist Ole J. Sneide from San Francisco, California, thinks they are “oblate spheroid space ships from other planets” with hidden bases on the dark side of the moon. This is apparently the first public mention of an extraterrestrial origin for flying saucers in the media.

**Date:** 7/5/1947  
**Locations:** Roswell, New Mexico; Pine Lodge Road northwest of Roswell  
**Description:** 5:00 a.m. Archaeologists, including [William Curry Holden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FCurry%5FHolden), working the sites around Roswell, New Mexico, stumble across an impact site where an object has crashed. One of them heads to the closest phone to tell Sheriff [George A. Wilcox](https://www.rdrnews.com/2018/11/12/a-sheriff-without-a-gun-memoirs-of-a-sheriffs-wife/) of the discovery of the remains of a crashed aircraft of some kind. Wilcox calls the local fire department to alert them about the crash. One truck, with [Dan Dwyer](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/dandwyer.htm) on it, responds to the call. The site is about 35–40 miles north of Roswell. The Roswell Fire Department, escorted by members of the Roswell Police Department, makes a run along Pine Lodge Road northwest of Roswell. They are among the first civilians to stumble across the impact site.

### <a name="FBC8D283"></a> Event 2721 (FBC8D283)
**Date:** 7/5/1947  
**Locations:** Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico; US Highway 285; Frankfurt, Germany  
**Description:** 5:30 a.m. According to discredited Roswell witness [Frank Kaufmann](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13371870/frank-j-kaufmann), a small contingent of men from Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico drive north on what is now US Highway 285. Near mile marker 132, they turn off the road and began driving across the desert, stopping from time to time to cut the barbed-wire fencing. They discover a heel-shaped craft measuring about 25 feet long and 12 feet wide embedded in a cliff. The soldiers find civilians on the site already. Besides the archaeologists, a local man named Larry Campbell \(later called Jack Armstrong or Cactus Jack\) also claims to have been there. They escort them off while others secure the area. Five bodies are allegedly found on the site. The impact site is cleaned and secured by 11:30 a.m. [Annie Jacobsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie%5FJacobsen) has interviewed [Alfred O’Donnell](https://obituaries.reviewjournal.com/obituary/alfred-o-donnell-1082038666), later an engineer at EG&G, who tells her that one of the objects crashed and was recovered by the Joint Chiefs, including the airframe, propulsion equipment, and the power plant. It has no wings or tail. The fuselage is round and there is a dome on top. Inside there are Cyrillic letters stamped or embossed in a ring running around the inside. Army intelligence officers suspect that the craft is the brainchild of German airplane engineers, [Walter and Reimar Horten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horten%5Fbrothers), working for the Russian military. A frantic search to find what happened to the brothers allegedly takes place; informants like Austrian physicist [Adolf Smekal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf%5FSmekal) of Frankfurt, Germany, provide leads, with confusing results for several months.

**Locations:** Roswell Army Air Field; Fort Stanton; Lincoln, New Mexico; Albuquerque; Fort Stanton cemetery  
**Description:** 10:00 a.m. W/O Robert Thomas and his crew proceed to the impact site. The bodies, originally covered by sheets, are now in lead-lined body bags. Only those with the highest clearance are allowed close to the center of the impact. Guards are posted, facing out, to keep the curious away. According to researcher Kathy Kasten, the dead bodies are taken to Roswell Army Air Field, but one is still alive and taken to Fort Stanton \[now closed\] in Lincoln, New Mexico, whose Marine Hospital was used to confine troublesome German and Japanese detainees during World War II. Allegedly, aerospace physician [William Randolph Lovelace II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FRandolph%5FLovelace%5FII) travels there from Albuquerque to examine the survivor, who reportedly dies one week later and is buried in the Fort Stanton cemetery.

### <a name="2DD935BB"></a> Event 2723 (2DD935BB)
**Date:** 7/5/1947  
**Location:** J. B. Foster ranch house southeast of Corona, New Mexico  
**Description:** Following the rain the night before, [Brazel](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9454979/william-ware-brazel) inspects the pastures surrounding the J. B. Foster ranch house southeast of Corona, New Mexico. Riding with him is the young son of the Proctors, [William D. Proctor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80134486/william-d-proctor). During the inspection, Brazel discovers a large debris field. Scattered on the slopes and into the sinkhole and depressions are plastic-like beams, pieces of lightweight balsawood-like material only stronger, light metallic foil \(which doesn’t stay bent or folded, resumes its original shape, and won’t tear\), and heavy-gauge monofilament. The debris is thick enough that the sheep refuse to cross the field and are driven around it to water more than a mile away. Brazel, taking a few scraps of the material, heads to the home of his closest neighbors, [Floyd](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99049640/floyd-proctor) and [Loretta](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/144211794/susan-loretta-proctor%5Fhodges) [Proctor](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/144211794/susan-loretta-proctor%5Fhodges)[.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/144211794/susan-loretta-proctor%5Fhodges) He shows them “a little sliver” of material that he can neither burn nor cut. Some of the beams have symbols on them that reminds Brazel of Chinese ideograms. The Proctors suggest he take it into town to show the sheriff.

Wilcox](https://www.rdrnews.com/2018/11/12/a-sheriff-without-a-gun-memoirs-of-a-sheriffs-wife/)[.](https://www.rdrnews.com/2018/11/12/a-sheriff-without-a-gun-memoirs-of-a-sheriffs-wife/) Contrary to published reports, Wilcox is excited about the find and suggests the military at the Roswell Army Air Field \[now closed\] be notified. While waiting for the military officers to arrive, Wilcox dispatches two of his deputies to the ranch. They have only the directions given by Brazel, but both men are familiar with the territory; and Wilcox believes they will be able to find the debris field. KGFL reporter Frank Joyce calls Wilcox, who tells him Brazel is in his office with an interesting story. Brazel allegedly gets on the phone with Joyce and mentions debris and a stench from dead bodies.

**Date:** 7/6/1947  
**Locations:** Roswell AAF; Ranch; Fort Worth Army Air Field; Washington, D.C.  
**Description:** Colonel [William H. Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%5FH.%5FBlanchard), Roswell AAF commanding officer, entrusted with oversight of the first and only atomic-bomb strike force in the world, the 509th Bomb Group, orders [Jesse A. Marcel](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/jessemarcel.htm), the air intelligence officer, to investigate the debris report. Marcel immediately drives to the sheriff’s office. Marcel interviews [Brazel](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9454979/william-ware-brazel)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9454979/william-ware-brazel) examines the pieces of the material that Brazel brought in, and decides he had better visit the ranch to examine the field for himself. Marcel, taking some of the debris with him, returns to the base and reports to Blanchard on what he has seen. Blanchard, convinced that he is in possession of something highly unusual, perhaps Soviet, alerts the next higher headquarters. Marcel and Blanchard all know this is from not any type of balloon. Marcel returns to the sheriff’s office with the senior counterintelligence agent assigned to the base, CIC Captain [Sheridan W.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/177397132/sheridan-wear-cavitt) [Cavitt](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/177397132/sheridan-wear-cavitt)[.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/177397132/sheridan-wear-cavitt) They escort Brazel back to his ranch and examine the debris field. Acting on orders from Major General [Clements McMullen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clements%5FMcMullen)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clements%5FMcMullen) deputy commander of the Strategic Air Command, Blanchard obtains more of the debris from the sheriff’s office. It is sealed in a courier pouch and loaded on an airplane to be flown on to the Fort Worth Army Air Field, where it is given to Colonel [Thomas J. DuBose](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/thomasdubose.htm) for transport on to Washington, D.C. After Marcel and Cavitt leave with Brazel, the two deputies return to say they did not find the debris field but observed a burned area in one of the pastures. There the sand has been turned to glass and blackened. It looks as if something circular has touched down.

**Date:** 7/7/1947  
**Location:** Roswell  
**Description:** [Brazel](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9454979/william-ware-brazel) takes [Marcel](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/jessemarcel.htm) and [Cavitt](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/177397132/sheridan-wear-cavitt) out to the debris field. It is three-quarters of a mile long and 200–300 feet wide. A gouge starting at the northern end of it extends for 400–500 feet toward the other end. It looks as if something has touched down and skipped along. The largest piece of debris is recovered at the southern edge of the gouge. The debris is as thin as newsprint, but incredibly strong. There is foil that, when crumpled, unfolds itself without a sign of a wrinkle, I-beams that flex slightly and have some symbols on them, and material resembling Bakelite. Marcel and Cavitt walk the perimeter of the field and then range out looking for more details or another crash site but find nothing else. Finally, they return and spend the remainder of the day collecting debris. They load the rear of Marcel’s car and then the jeep carryall driven by Cavitt. About dusk they begin the trip back to Roswell.

### <a name="AE762C1A"></a> Event 3014 (AE762C1A)
**Date:** 7/8/1947  
**Locations:** Muroc AFB [now Edwards AFB]; Rogers Dry Lake  
**Description:** 9:30 a.m.–9:20 p.m. Five separate UFO sightings take place at Muroc AFB \[now Edwards AFB\] in southern California, the Air Force’s aircraft testing and development center. [Ruppelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FJ.%5FRuppelt) says these are the first sightings “that really made the Air Force take a deep interest in UFOs.” At 9:30 a.m., 1st Lt. [Joseph C. McHenry](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/69719785/joseph-charles-mchenry) and three others see three discs heading in a westerly direction. At 10:10 a.m., XP-84 test pilot Maj. [Jowell C. Wise](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41163741/jowell-clark-wise) sees a yellowish-white object at 10,000 feet traveling about 200 mph. At 11:50 a.m., Maj. [Richard R. Shoop](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/197896549/richard-raymond-shoop), Col. S. A. Gilkey, and Capt. [John P. Stapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%5FStapp) are sitting in an observation truck at Rogers Dry Lake and see a round, white aluminum-like object descending from 20,000 feet for about 90 seconds; it has two knobs or thick fins on the top. Around 4:00 p.m., a pilot flying an F-51 some 40 miles south of Muroc sees a “flat object of a light-reflecting nature”; it is flying too high for him to climb up to it. At 9:20 p.m., spherical objects are again seen in the area, this time at 8,000 feet and moving against the wind at 300 mph.

### <a name="DEEAD3A6"></a> Event 3019 (DEEAD3A6)
**Date:** 7/8/1947  
**Locations:** Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas; Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio; Corona, New Mexico; Roswell, New Mexico  
**Description:** 1:00 p.m. [Marcel](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19717326/jesse-antoine-marcel) goes on a B-29 special flight \(the second\) to Fort Worth Army Air Field, Texas, with the wreckage to report to Gen. [Roger M. Ramey](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/1686367/lt-gen-roger-m-ramey/). The pilot is Lt. Col. [Payne Jennings Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne%5FJennings%5FJr) with Lt. Col. [Robert](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81472407/robert-ivan-barrowclough) [Barrowclough](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81472407/robert-ivan-barrowclough) riding in the bombardier’s seat. Only a few packages are loaded onto the plane. One, a triangular package about two feet long, is wrapped in brown paper. The other three are about the size of shoe boxes. They are so light that it feels as if there is nothing in them. When it lands in Fort Worth, the enlisted soldiers on the plane are ordered to remain aboard until a guard is posted and Marcel gets off taking one of the packages that he has been carrying on his lap. According to Flight Engineer M/Sgt. [Robert Porter](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/robertporter.htm), the soldiers go to the mess hall once the guard is posted. The remaining debris is transferred to a B-25 that is flying to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. Marcel goes to Ramey’s office and puts the package on his desk. They both go to a map room, where Marcel shows him where the debris was found. When they return to Ramey’s office, Marcel sees that the package he brought has been substituted by a torn-up weather balloon. Ramey proposes a plan that possibly originates from his bosses at the Pentagon. Attention needs to be diverted from the more important impact site north of Roswell by acknowledging the Corona location. Too many civilians are involved, and the press is already alerted.

### <a name="CF3E3961"></a> Event 3025 (CF3E3961)
**Date:** 7/8/1947  
**Locations:** Roswell; Fort Worth, Texas  
**Description:** 4:30 p.m. The Roswell Daily Record carries the “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer” story. In Fort Worth, Texas, [Ramey](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/1686367/lt-gen-roger-m-ramey/) issues a statement saying the Roswell officers were fooled and that the material is a Rawin target device suspended by a Neoprene rubber balloon. \(“Rawin” is a method of determining wind speed and direction by using radar or radio waves to track a balloon carrying either a radar-sensitive target or radio transponder.\). The debris is switched for the newspaper photographer, [James Bond Johnson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/47401399/james-bond-johnson), at a press conference held by Ramey and Col. [Thomas J. DuBose](https://ufologie.patrickgross.org/rw/w/thomasdubose.htm) in late afternoon. Johnson takes six photos of the debris and leaves after 20 minutes. One of the photos shows Ramey holding a piece of paper \(the “Ramey memo”\) with words written on it; unfortunately, the resolution is inadequate to decisively “deblur” the text using modern technological methods. A weather officer, Maj. [Irving Newton](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sanantonio/obituary.aspx?n=irving-newton&pid=134553090)[,](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sanantonio/obituary.aspx?n=irving-newton&pid=134553090) is called in to identify the debris as from a balloon. A photo of Newton with the debris is taken by another photographer.

### <a name="80987B71"></a> Event 3028 (80987B71)
**Date:** 7/8/1947  
**Description:** There are at least 74 UFO reports recorded for this day in the UFOCAT database. At ten o'clock in the morning an aluminum colored, pancake shaped object was sighted by a farmer as it flew over Corapeake, North Carolina. It flew at an estimated 800 mph at 2,000 feet altitude. He described it as having two windows and protruding pipe-like extensions, and emitting vapor and making a slight noise. At 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time an ovoid object was sighted over Norfolk, Virginia. It was seen rocking and spinning, and followed by smaller objects. An Air Force major observed a metallic object at Muroc Field (now Edwards AFB) in California at noon. The object reflected sunlight and oscillated up and down in the sky, going down to ground level then rising again. It was observed simultaneously by a captain in Rodgers Dry Lake Bed. At the same time a student pilot sighted at flying disc that looked like it had a hole in its center, flying at 500 feet altitude over Spokane, Washington. At 5:33 p.m. an object flew in a zigzag pattern over Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii. At 9:47 p.m. five teenagers camping out at a golf course in Madison, Wisconsin saw a flat, brilliant disc close to the horizon. It flew from the southeast to the northwest very quickly.

### <a name="8D15C774"></a> Event 3064 (8D15C774)
**Date:** 7/9/1947  
**Locations:** Midland, Michigan; Dow Chemical Company materials research laboratory in Midland  
**Description:** Shortly after 5:00 p.m. Electrician Raymond Edward Lane and his wife are picking huckleberries near Midland, Michigan, when they hear a kind of “puff” noise nearby. Looking up, they see a ball of white, sparkling fire, like a Fourth of July sparkler, about the size of a bushel basket, no more than 100 feet away. It is hovering several feet above a stretch of sand. After about 10 or 15 seconds, the light goes out and the object vanishes. The only thing that remains is a peculiar dark substance on the sand and some metallic fragments. Lane collects fragments of the material in a tin can and brings them the next morning to Robert S. Spencer, a senior researcher at the Dow Chemical Company materials research laboratory in Midland. Spencer goes to the site with Lane and Dow’s internal security chief Edward Fales. Spencer has the Dow spectroscopy laboratory analyze the fragments and reports that the shiny pellets are largely silver mixed with a bit of silicon. They conclude that it consists of fused sand. By the end of September, the lab has analyzed ashlike powder found at the site. It turns out to be thorite that is slightly radioactive, mixed with magnesium hydroxide and other trace minerals. The conclusion is that the sighting is the result of some kind of home-made fireworks experiment, although Dow chemist [John Josef Grebe](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/107960608/john-josef-grebe) suspects it might have been a small missile.

**Description:** 5:30 p.m. Three civilian airline mechanics \(John N. Mehrman Jr., Robert Leidy, and John E. Woodruff\) at Ernest Harmon AFB \[now Stephenville International Airport\] are returning from a fishing trip and driving up a mountain road near Stephenville Crossing, Newfoundland. They see a bluish-black exhaust trail that has cut through some clouds leaving a “hole.” Woodruff sees a disc-shaped object the apparent size of a C-54 transport plane coming out of the clouds and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. The hole remains in the cloud for more than an hour. Leidy takes two Kodachrome photos of the exhaust trail. The sighting later impresses Project Sign personnel to the extent that they ask questions about UFO effects on clouds.

**Description:** [Kenneth Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth%5FArnold) is interviewed at the Hotel Owyhee in Boise, Idaho, by Lt. [Frank M. Brown](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65326329/frank-mercer-brown) and Capt. [William](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43927275/william-lee-davidson) [L. Davidson](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43927275/william-lee-davidson)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43927275/william-lee-davidson) who have flown in from Hamilton Army Airfield \[now closed\] in Novato, California. He also submits a written statement to Army Air Force intelligence, referring to the objects as “saucer-like.” At the end of the report he draws a picture of what the objects appeared to look like at their closest approach to Mt. Rainier, Washington. He writes, “They seemed longer than wide, their thickness was about 1/20th their width.” As to motion, Arnold writes, “They flew like many times I have observed geese to fly in a rather diagonal chain-like line as if they were linked together.” \(James Easton suggests in 2007 that Arnold may have seen pelicans, based on their movements, but this seems unlikely.\) While they are at Arnold’s house, Brown and Davidson hear that pilot Emil J. Smith is in Boise on a layover, and all three go to the airport to talk to him.

**Description:** At 10:30 a.m. in Syracuse, New York a 13-year-old boy saw a long, featureless cigar-shaped object hovering over an orchard only 100 meters away. At 1:00 p.m. in Wilkesboro, North Carolina a buzzing noise was heard and then a disc shot through the sky fast at an altitude of 1500 meters. At 7:20 p.m. a small disc flew over a farm south of Idaho Falls, Idaho flying on an irregular course, low and slow. It tilted, then flew away to the southwest making an odd sound.

**Date:** Mid 7/1947  
**Description:** In a paper by U.S. Navy Physicist, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, he stated: “...the Air Force knew by the middle of July, 1947 that saucers were real and not manmade...the technology represented by the (recovered) disc...was so far beyond our own that it could not be understood immediately...Therefore it would be necessary to treat the disc as a military secret. This would mean containing all information about it within some small group.”

**Date:** 7/23/1947  
**Locations:** Campina do Amoral; Colônia Goio-Bang; Luiziana; Mamboré; Paraná; Brazil  
**Description:** José C. Higgens and some assistants are surveying a field in Campina do Amoral in the Colônia Goio-Bang, located between Luiziana and Mamboré, Paraná, Brazil. On hearing a sharp sound, they see a grayish-white disc- shaped object about 100 feet in diameter, which soon lands and rests on curved metal feet. His assistants flee, but Higgens goes up to examine it. He sees a small, glass window, then two odd-looking beings observing him curiously. A door opens in the craft, and three other hairless beings dressed in transparent overalls. They have large, round eyes with eyebrows and pronounced eyelashes. Their legs are disproportionately long and they are about 7 feet tall. One points a small tube at Higgens. They are speaking in an unknown, sonorous language. He walks toward the door and can see only a small cubicle, bordered by another door, and several portholes. Higgens by gestures asks where they are from and the leader draws a map in the dirt, indicating a seventh planet, presumably Uranus. He eludes them by pretending to look for his wife and goes into a hidden spot in the woods. After 30 minutes the beings climb into the object and take off.

**Date:** 7/26/1947  
**Location:** Joint Research and Development Board  
**Description:** President [Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%5FS.%5FTruman) signs the National Security Act, a major restructuring of the military and intelligence agencies. It creates a unified National Military Establishment \(Army and Navy\) and a Department of the Air Force, both under the new Secretary of Defense. The Joint Research and Development Board becomes the R&D brain center. Each of the three service secretaries maintains quasi-cabinet status. It establishes the National Security Council to advise the president and the Central Intelligence Agency, the first peacetime intelligence agency in the US. The CIA is prohibited from conducting domestic surveillance, but [Allen Dulles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%5FDulles) ensures it can handle “other functions” affecting “national security” without scrutiny from Congress or \(sometimes\) the president. Much of the CIA’s funding initially comes from wealthy Americans. The act creates the first black military and intelligence budget.

He gets a room \(502\) at the Winthrop Hotel, where a room and a bath have already been mysteriously reserved for him. [Harold A. Dahl](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/125878620/harold-albert-dahl) visits Arnold that night, then takes him to [Fred Crisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred%5FCrisman)’s place to see some Maury Island fragments. Arnold thinks it looks like lava.

Something is really flying around.” Also, “Lack of topside inquiries . . . give more than ordinary weight to the possibility that this is a domestic project, about which the President, etc., know.” The study is passed up the line to Gen.

**Description:** Capt. [Edward Ruppelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FJ.%5FRuppelt): “By the end of July 1947, the UFO security lid was down tight. The few members of the press who did inquire about what the Air Force was doing got the same treatment that you would get today if you inquired about the number of thermonuclear weapons stock-piled in the U.S.’s atomic arsenal. . . \[At T-2 there was\] confusion almost to the point of panic."

**Location:** Bethel, Alaska  
**Description:** Pilots Capt. [Jack](https://alaskaairmuseum.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jack-peck.jpg) [Peck](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25121894/jack-randall-peck) and Vince Daly see a smooth UFO northwest of Bethel, Alaska, dead ahead as they are flying a DC-3 for Al Jones Flying Service. Peck hauls back on his controls to bring his plane up to safer altitude. Now 1,000 feet higher, the pilots glance downward and spot the UFO closer but on a changed course. Still dark against the sky, it looks to be as large as a C-54. Intrigued, Peck dives on the object as it pulls away, doing his best to get a better view, but it speeds up to an estimated 500 mph and is lost to view in four minutes.

**Description:** The Seattle, Washington, FBI office interrogates [Crisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred%5FCrisman) and [Dahl](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/125878620/harold-albert-dahl) and announces the Maury Island incident is a hoax. The FBI file notes that Dahl stated that “if questioned by the authorities he was going to say it was a hoax because he did not want any further trouble over the matter.” Dahl’s daughter Louise admits in 2007 that the whole story was made up, as did her brother Charles in the late 1960s, who called Crisman a “smooth-talking con artist.” The affair had started as a joke and blossomed into something worse. Associated Press reporter Elmer Vogel says that Dahl’s wife had compelled him to tell Vogel the truth. [Morello](https://tedmorellojournalist.wordpress.com/) also speaks to Crisman, who admits the story is baseless.

**Date:** 8/9/1947  
**Location:** Oak Ridge, Tennessee  
**Description:** [John Derry](https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/john-derry)[,](https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/john-derry) serving as acting general manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, proposes a set of guidelines that restate the proposition that secrecy can be based on reasons other than national security. The definition of Confidential that he proposes goes beyond the Army and Manhattan Project rules: “CONFIDENTIAL: Documents, information or material, the unauthorized disclosure of which, while not endangering the National security, would be prejudicial to the interests or prestige of the Nation or any Governmental activity, or individual, or would cause administrative embarrassment, or be of advantage to a foreign nation shall be classified CONFIDENTIAL.” The Derry memo calls for review by a classification board assembled from the AEC’s regional sites. In September, this board assembles in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The available documentation does not show that Derry’s proposed rules go into effect, but it does show that the Classification Board blesses the illustrations of matter that “should be graded” Secret or Confidential.

### <a name="18D0F82F"></a> Event 3318 (18D0F82F)
**Date:** 8/13/1947  
**Description:** Mr. A. C. Urie and his two sons were fishing in the Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho at about one p.m. when they saw a sky blue, seven-meter wide inverted plate-shaped flying object 100 meters away and 25 meters above the ground. Treetops under it were spinning wildly, although the object itself did not appear to spin. It made a swishing sound. There was a red flame visible on one side of the top. According to the FBI investigative report of this case, at about 1:00 p.m. Mr. Urie "sent his boys to the (Salmon) river to get some rope from his boat. When he thought they were overdue he went outside to his tool shed to look for them. He noticed them about 300 feet away looking in the sky and he glanced up to see what he called the flying disc. This strange object was flying at high speed along the canyon which is about 400 feet deep and 1,200 feet across at that point. It was about seventy-five feet above the floor of the canyon (and so more than 300 feet below the edge of the canyon) and moving up and down as it flew. It seemed to be following the contours of the hilly ground beneath it. Urie, who said he was at about the same level as the UFO, so that he had a side view, estimated it was about twenty feet long, ten feet wide and ten feet high, with what appeared to be exhaust ports on the sides. It was almost hat shaped with a flat bottom and a dome on top.<br/><br/> Its pale blue color made Urie think that it would be very difficult to see against the sky, although he had no trouble seeing it silhouetted against the opposite wall of the canyon. On each side there was a tubular shaped fiery glow, like some sort of exhaust. He said that when it went over trees they didn't sway back and forth, but rather the treetops twisted around, which suggests that the air under the object was being swirled into a vortex. He and his sons had an excellent view of the object for a few seconds before it disappeared over the trees about a mile away. He thought it was going 1,000 miles an hour.

**Description:** Shortly after 9:00 a.m. Italian artist and author [Luigi Rapuzzi](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.%5FR.%5FJohannis) \(who uses the pseudonym L. R. Johannis\) is hiking along the left bank of the Torrente Chiarzò near Raveo, Udine, Italy, when he sees a vivid red, metallic, domed disc on the riverbank about 165 feet ahead. It is about 33 feet wide and embedded in a cleft in the rock about 20 feet above thqwe stream. Looking around, he sees two “boys” on the edge of a grove of trees. He shouts at them and points to the object, walking toward them, but notices they are actually odd-looking dwarfs who are approaching him stiffly. They are about 3 feet tall and wearing dark blue coveralls with red collars, cuffs, and belts. Their greenish heads are covered in tight-fitting, brownish caps. He looks at them in astonishment for 2–3 minutes, then waves his geologist’s pick at them and asks where they come from. One of the entities raises its right hand to its belt, which emits a puff of smoke that knocks Rapuzzi to the ground as if from an electric shock. As he is lying there, one of them grabs his pick and he notices its green hand has 8 claws. They climb up the rock and into the disc, which soon shoots straight out and into the air, hovering briefly at an angle, then vanishes. Rapuzzi feels a blast of wind that blows him across the ground. His pick is missing.

**Date:** 8/14/1947  
**Description:** At around nine o'clock in the morning R. L. Johannis of Raveo, Italy saw a 10 meter wide, red domed, disc-shaped object with an antenna on top, on the ground across an ice field. There were two dwarfs less than three feet tall near the craft, wearing dark blue coveralls with red collars and belts. They had oversized heads and greenish toned faces. Their eyes were huge, without eyelashes or eyebrows but surrounded by some kind of ring-like muscle. The beings had greenish hands with eight talon-like fingers. They wore something similar to crash helmets. When he waved his ice axe at them in a friendly gesture, one of the beings discharged a thin puff of smoke or "vapor" at him which knocked him down, and the witness started to suffocate, feeling at the same time a strong electrical discharge.

### <a name="44D8AE0F"></a> Event 3410 (44D8AE0F)
**Date:** 9/23/1947  
**Location:** Oak Ridge  
**Description:** Head of Air Materiel Command Gen. [Nathan Twining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan%5FFarragut%5FTwining) responds to [Schulgen](http://www.generals.dk/general/Schulgen/George%5FFrancis/USA.html)’s request for UFO information with a classified letter composed by Col. [McCoy](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2014/10/colonel-howard-mccoy-and-mj-12.html) with the assistance of [Alfred Loedding](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/209268646/alfred-christian-loedding), “AMC Opinion Concerning ‘Flying Disks.’” Twining notes the discs are “real and not visionary or fictitious.” Reports \(based on the cases in the Garrett Estimate\) include “extreme rates of climb, maneuverability \(particularly in roll\), and action which must be considered evasive.” Twining gives three reasons to study the discs: They might represent a deep-black domestic project; to pick up physical evidence; and to find out if they are nuclear- propulsion devices from Russia or elsewhere. The letter lists common descriptions of the objects and recommends that USAF “issue a directive assigning a priority, security classification, and code name for a detailed study of the matter.” This will ultimately result in Project Sign. Henceforth all disc reports are to be sent to the Army and Navy Research and Development Board, the USAF Scientific Advisory Group, the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Project RAND, and the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft project at Oak Ridge. Twining promises a detailed “Essential Elements of Information” \(EEI\) to be formulated immediately so that all agencies will have guidance.

Titled “Intelligence Requirements on Flying Saucer Type Aircraft: Draft of Collection Memorandum,” it lists things investigators should try to determine about UFO propulsion, control, construction, arrangement, landing gear, and power plant. It considers the objects “to be a manned aircraft, of Russian origin, and based on the perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the Germans” \(page 5, paragraph 4\). \[However, a fake version of this document has the phrase “it is the considered opinion of some elements that the object may in fact represent an interplanetary craft of some kind…. The presence of an unconventional or unusual type of propulsion system cannot be ruled out and should be considered of great interest.” Other deletions and additions are present in the fake document.\]

**Date:** 12/1947  
**Location:** USAF Aeromedical Laboratory  
**Description:** By now, ATIC has received 156 UFO reports. Aerodynamicists at ATIC and AMC agree that no German design can match UFO performance. The USAF Aeromedical Laboratory says that even if such a craft can be built, the human body cannot withstand the maneuvers, and USAF materials specialists say that no known material can withstand them either, as well as the heat of high speeds. [Ruppelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FJ.%5FRuppelt) later writes, “Why couldn’t these people, whoever they might be, stand these horrible maneuver forces? Why judge them by earthly standards? I found a memo to this effect was in the old Project Sign files.”

**Date:** 1948  
**Locations:** Lockbourne AFB [now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base] in Lockbourne, Ohio; Ohio River  
**Description:** David T. Keating, an employee of the USAF Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft group, is flying with the 166th Fighter Squadron of the Ohio National Guard out of Lockbourne AFB \[now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base\] in Lockbourne, Ohio. While executing a flip of his P-51 at 18,000 feet, he sees a silvery disc zoom above his plane. He goes in pursuit of it at 325 mph and closes to within 240 feet of it. It seems to be 40 feet in diameter and 6 feet thick, with a vertical stabilizer rudder on the end. He keeps flying after it even when he loses sight of it. “About 10 miles south of the Ohio River,” he claims, “I spotted litter on a hillside and a path that had obviously been ripped up by a crashing plane.” Short on fuel, he returns to Lockbourne. He persuades his major to fly over the crash scene, and they send a truck to retrieve the remains.

They discover that the ship is constructed of interlocking sections pinned together, but they cannot locate a power plant, except possibly some electromagnets below the cabin.

### <a name="79A0A62C"></a> Event 3529 (79A0A62C)
**Date:** 1/7/1948  
**Locations:** Louisville, Kentucky; Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Franklin, Kentucky; Ohio State University; Camp Ripley near Little Falls, Minnesota  
**Description:** 2:50 p.m. Capt. [Thomas F. Mantell Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14958603/thomas-francis-mantell)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14958603/thomas-francis-mantell) a 25-year-old Kentucky Air National Guard pilot, and three others are flying F-51D fighters to Louisville, Kentucky. After Mantell reports his position to Standiford Field in Louisville, Tech/Sgt. [Quinton A. Blackwell](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/39533254/quinton-a%5F-blackwell) at Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox breaks in over the radio to request Mantell to intercept and identify the object. The object maintains a constant angular position as seen from Godman as it apparently moves away at about 240–300 mph at an altitude of 50,000–60,000 feet during most of Mantell’s pursuit. Flying at 300 mph and gradually climbing to about 22,000–23,000 feet, Mantell gradually overtakes the UFO from below, past Bowling Green, Kentucky, at about 3:10 p.m. In one of his last radio reports, Mantell says the UFO “appears to be a metallic object or possibly reflection of sun from a metallic object, and it is of tremendous size.” At 3:15 p.m., at 22,500 feet with oxygen running low, two other F-51Ds quit the chase. Mantell continues to 25,000, blacks out, and crashes at 3:18 p.m. about 4 miles south-southwest of Franklin, Kentucky. The UFO disappears from view behind a cloud at Godman at 3:50 p.m. The Project Sign staff, still not yet formally organized, are under pressure to come up with some kind of answer, so they quickly float Venus \(offhandedly suggested by Ohio State University astronomer [J. Allen Hynek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%5FAllen%5FHynek)\) as an explanation. This implausible explanation is not even believed by the Air Force, but it remains unchallenged for several years. In 1952, [Ruppelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FJ.%5FRuppelt) reopens the case and identifies the object as a secret Skyhook balloon, although he cannot confirm a launch that day. Army veteran [Clifford Stone](https://ufology.fandom.com/wiki/Clifford%5FStone) finds later that there had been no Skyhook launches since late December. However, [Barry J. Greenwood](http://www.noufors.com/Barry%5FJ%5FGreenwood.htm) and [Robert Todd](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2007/04/robert-todd-is-gone.html) tentatively identify the balloon as one launched from Camp Ripley near Little Falls, Minnesota, on January 6.

### <a name="A70735A9"></a> Event 3531 (A70735A9)
**Date:** 1/7/1948  
**Locations:** Lockbourne AFB [now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base] in Lockbourne, Ohio; Commercial Point; Lockbourne AFB runway  
**Description:** 7:15 p.m. Air Traffic Controller and pilot [Alex A. Boudreaux](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65980757/alex-a-boudreaux) and VHF Direction-Finding \(DF\) Operator and amateur astronomer [Frank M. Eisele](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86972303/frank-m-eisele)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86972303/frank-m-eisele) 103rd AACS Squadron, at Lockbourne AFB \[now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base\] in Lockbourne, Ohio, spot a bright object to the southwest of the airfield that appears and disappears intermittently. Fighter pilot USAF Capt. [Charles E. McGee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FMcGee%5F%28pilot%29) sees the object on runway 23 landing approach when he is at about 1,800 feet. The light seems to be at about 3,000 feet to the southwest about 4–5 miles away, then later on the ground to the west about 6–7 miles away. USAF VHF DF Operator and pilot Albert R. Pickering, Detachment 733, 103rd AACS Squadron, is awakened by the sudden emergence of a lighted amber- colored round or oval object about the size of a C-47 or larger \[60+ feet\] dropping out of the overcast bank 10,000 feet overhead. Lockbourne Control Tower at the same time radios a report of the object, which then maneuvers over to Commercial Point about 3–5 miles away to the west-southwest, then makes three full 360° circles over one spot in 30-40 seconds per turn over the runway, at a speed of more than 500 mph, leaving a luminous, amber- colored trail or exhaust about 5 times its length. Then the UFO goes to another location and does more 360° turns. At one point, it disappears into the overcast for one minute, then reappears. Just before departing, it hovers or “appeared to touch down” on the grass extension past the end of the Lockbourne AFB runway for 10 seconds then leaves at 120° \(ESE\) heading into the overcast. It is also sighted by the pilot of a C-45 at 5,000 feet off the right wing at 7:53 p.m.

He has been accumulating information on unidentified radar targets \(he calls them “gizmos”\) that cannot be seen with the naked eye and sending reports on their flight paths to Navy meteorologist [Florence Van Straten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence%5Fvan%5FStraten) and [Luis Walter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis%5FWalter%5FAlvarez) [Alvarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis%5FWalter%5FAlvarez)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis%5FWalter%5FAlvarez) the inventor of Ground Control Approach System radar. In many cases, the target indicates a small solid target flying around 30 mph. The targets always fly in the same path from northwest to southeast, along the coast. Sometimes they come to a complete halt; at other times they split into two objects, merging later. Ehlers notes that the targets have been attributed to insects, but he is skeptical. Later, he suspects they might be plasmas occurring at the inversion layer, but that does not explain their behavior.

### <a name="CB00DA4C"></a> Event 3580 (CB00DA4C)
**Date:** 3/25/1948  
**Location:** Aztec, NM  
**Description:** Aztec area NM landing and retrieval incident near Hart Canyon. UFO detected by 3 strategically located radars in the southwest, including a powerful experimental radar in the Four Corners region. The Army OSI and the IPU put on Red Alert and the ADC activated the local military units when a UFO crashed in the vicinity of Aztec, NM. When the saucer got into range of a Special High-Powered radar at the Four Corners Range (Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado) it began to flutter and wobble from side-to-side and took a trajectory towards the ground. It seems that the beam from this special radar had an ill-effect on the control system of the saucer. The 100 ft. saucer crash-landed on Mr. H.D.’s (initials) property. H.D. and family were sworn to secrecy. Note: This may have been the White Sands 1948 incident mentioned by Virgil Armstrong.

### <a name="D2B58BAD"></a> Event 3582 (D2B58BAD)
**Date:** 3/25/1948  
**Locations:** Hart Canyon Road east of Aztec, New Mexico; Wright Field in Ohio; Arizona; Phoenix; North Carolina  
**Description:** 5:00 a.m. According to writer [Frank Scully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%5FScully), who hears the tale from a scientist he refers to as “Dr. Gee” and a Texas oilman, a UFO crashes on a rocky plateau off Hart Canyon Road east of Aztec, New Mexico. When Air Force investigators and government scientists arrive on the scene, they crawl through a broken porthole and find the bodies of 16 small humanlike beings \(3–3.5 feet tall\) dressed in the “style of 1890.” Their skin is charred a chocolate color, apparently as a result of the rush of terrestrial air through the shattered window. After a thorough study, the scientists conclude that the “vehicle probably flew on magnetic lines of force.” Segments of the craft, as well as the bodies, are supposedly transported to Wright Field in Ohio. Dr. Gee, who claims to have been on the scene, said the UFO is likely from Venus, as Martians “would probably be three or four times as large as human beings.” Soon afterward, a crash occurs in Arizona and 16 bodies are taken from the wreckage. A third spaceship goes down near Phoenix with 2 dead occupants. The story turns out to be a hoax dreamed up by two con men named [Silas Newton](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127850405/silas-mason-newton) and [Leo GeBauer](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/leo-gebauer-and-silas-newton-flak-one-of-their-defense-news-photo/162001660) \(“Dr. Gee,” although Scully claims this was a composite character incorporating 8 informants, one of whom is said to be geophysicist [Carl A. Heiland](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/205437488/carl-a%5F-heiland)\). The hoax is loosely based on a 1949 science fiction film titled The Flying Saucer. GeBauer and especially Newton are in later years involved in various swindles and fraudulent mining claims. In 1987, [William S. Steinman](https://rr0.org/people/s/SteinmanWilliamS.html) and [Wendelle C. Stevens](http://www.openminds.tv/wendelle-stevens-passes-214/5310) release UFO Crash at Aztec, which draws on speculation, rumor, unnamed informants, and paranoia to defend and embellish the original story. The latest to champion the Aztec crash is a North Carolina man named [Scott](https://www.daily-times.com/story/archives/2015/03/28/ufo-authors-return-hart-canyon-67-years-after/75996314/) [Ramsey](https://www.daily-times.com/story/archives/2015/03/28/ufo-authors-return-hart-canyon-67-years-after/75996314/)[,](https://www.daily-times.com/story/archives/2015/03/28/ufo-authors-return-hart-canyon-67-years-after/75996314/) who with his wife Suzanne has spent thousands of dollars looking for and interviewing witnesses and trying to prove it involves a real UFO crash and coverup in his 2015 book The Aztec UFO Incident. Ramsey thinks the object was tracked on radar by Air Force Station P-8 near El Vado Dam.

At 1,500 feet, he notices an unusual silvery object about 3 miles to the east. Shaped like a flying wing or half-moon with a “turtle back,” it resembles no military craft in use at the time. The object flies below the squadron at 200 mph and an altitude of about 1,000 feet. Meyers estimates it is about 30 feet wide and 20 feet long. When he attempts to contact the other three P-47s, he realizes his radio is dead. As he makes a 270° left turn to get a closer look, the object makes a 90° left turn and moves away at tremendous speed. It is only visible for about 5 seconds.

It was shaped like an inverted bowl, about 10-15 meters in diameter, and surmounted by a transparent looking dome or “upside-down cup.” It was also emitting a very bright beam of white light. A humanoid being floated down to the ground from the object. He wore a stiff, metallic looking one-piece garment with heavy metallic gauntlets.

### <a name="883076D1"></a> Event 3596 (883076D1)
**Date:** 4/5/1948  
**Locations:** Holloman AFB; Alamogordo, New Mexico; Watson Laboratories; New Mexico; Red Bank, New Jersey; Watson Laboratory complex  
**Description:** Afternoon. At Holloman AFB, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, three highly trained balloon observers \(Joseph Olson, Johnson, and Chance\) are working on a secret project for the Air Force’s Watson Laboratories. They see two objects. One observer follows one object, and the others follow the second as they diverge. All are certain that the objects aren’t balloons. They are large, whitish, roundish, very high, faster than any aircraft, and perform rapid, erratic motions. One object is lost at a low altitude. The other goes up quickly and seems to just disappear. The observation lasts about 30 seconds. The case is deemed important enough to send [Alfred Loedding](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/209268646/alfred-christian-loedding) and one of [Clingerman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113944251/william-r%5F-clingerman)’s assistants, Lt. Col. James C. Beam \(the head of Project Sign\), to New Mexico to interview Project Mogul scientist James W. Peoples and the other witnesses. Unfortunately, they are gone when Sign arrives. \(They are later interviewed at the USAF Watson Laboratory complex in Red Bank, New Jersey.\) The witnesses are very sure of themselves and the case is classed as “Unidentified.” While at Holloman, Loedding and Beam talk with Lt. Herbert G. Markley, who has worked with the Watson team. Markley remembers one of them speaking of unusual radar returns from their equipment, but later the Watson personnel say that these were probably just “angels” \(spurious echoes due to atmospheric microstructures, insects, equipment malfunction, or other stimuli\). Markley does report that UFOs are seen around Holloman often. He himself has seen a disc in late August 1947 and flat, round aeroforms on at least two further occasions.

**Date:** 5/15/1948  
**Locations:** Enewetak Atoll; Marshall Islands; Los Alamos, New Mexico  
**Description:** During the Zebra nuclear detonation at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, a manned aircraft accidentally flies through the mushroom cloud. Because the pilot and crew “suffered no ill effects,” the Air Force decides that piloted aircraft could collect samples. The Los Alamos, New Mexico, personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones have apparently carried out the same procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffer radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who carries out the procedure for Yoke is then also found to have burns on his hands and is also hospitalized but is discharged on May 28. Once again, the drone tank gives trouble and bogs in the crater, but the soil samples are retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks are subsequently dumped in the ocean.

Visiting US Maj. [Robin Olds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin%5FOlds) is in one of the jets. They encounter a 100-foot oval object with three bumps or protrusions on the bottom, as Jones describes it through binoculars. Ground radar tracks the object, which is stationary and above 25,000 feet. Two jets go up to try to get a better look and get within a few thousand feet. The object departs vertically at a speed of 1,500 mph.

**Date:** 6/16/1948  
**Location:** Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia  
**Description:** Soviet test pilot Arkady Ivanovich Apraksin is flying at an altitude of 6.5 miles above a solid layer of clouds south of the Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. He sees an unconventional aircraft in the shape of a cucumber with cones of light radiating from it descending across his path. The base tells him it has tracked the object on radar and given it instructions to land, but it does not respond. Apraksin is ordered to intercept it and open fire if it refuses to land. When he closes to within 6 miles, the light beams open up like a fan and shine into his aircraft, blinding him. The plane’s electrical systems malfunction. He glides the plane to a safe landing after the UFO disappears. Apraksin is interrogated heavily.

### <a name="A3D4B79A"></a> Event 3683 (A3D4B79A)
**Date:** 7/7/1948  
**Locations:** 30 miles south-southwest of Laredo, Texas; San Antonio, Texas  
**Description:** A silver, disc-shaped object allegedly crashes some 30 miles south-southwest of Laredo, Texas. US servicemen are reportedly dispatched from a nearby military base to cordon off the UFO crash site until a special US retrieval team arrives to examine the wreckage and carry it away to a military base in San Antonio, Texas. Supposedly the badly burned body of a nonhuman entity is recovered from the crash site. Ufologist [Leonard Stringfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard%5FH.%5FStringfield) hears rumors of the crash in 1977, but few further details emerge. Early in 1978, Stringfield describes the humanoid found at the crash site as “about 4 feet, 6 inches tall, completely hairless, with hands that had no thumbs.” That description seems to fit the body shown in two photographs that are mailed to Willard F. McIntyre in December 1978. The body depicted in the photos sent to McIntyre has come to be known as the “Tomato Man” due to its large, roundish head. Many UFO researchers, including [Ron Schaffner](http://www.unknownexplorers.com/ronschaffner.php) and [Kevin Randle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin%5FD.%5FRandle), believe the body is that of a human pilot who is badly disfigured by intense heat following a plane crash. They argue that one of the photos shows a pair of eyeglasses, such as a human pilot would wear, near the body.

**Description:** Burlington, Vermont -- A fresh wave of UFO reports started Sunday, July 11, 1948 when Robert H. Streeten of West Bolton, Vermont notified authorities that he had sighted a "flying saucer" at 4:40 p.m. Three hours later Mrs. Ralph Holmes, wife of a University of Vermont physics professor, said she observed a fiery object whizzing through the sky. Miss Alice Giroux, a University of Vermont coed, and Miss Irene Audette of Hartford, Connecticut, a visiting skier, both reported seeing a flying saucer. One Vermonter, Dr. C. H. Vaughn of Burlington, said he saw a bluish-white flying saucer land in Massachusetts between Concord and Lexington. He was driving his car when he saw the object. Altogether, 20 people reported sighting flying saucers--round ones, square ones, and a few with handsome flue tails--in Chittenden and Franklin Counties.

**Description:** Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter: At roughly 2:45 AM on July 24, 1948, two commercial pilots, Clarence S. Chiles and John B. Whitted, claimed to have observed a "glowing object" pass by their plane before it appeared to pull up into a cloud and travel out of sight. The object closed on their DC-3 in a matter of seconds, and both men later said they saw the object fly past the right side of their plane at high speed before it pulled "up with a tremendous burst of flame out of its rear and zoomed up into the clouds." They observed the object for a total of ten to fifteen seconds. Chiles and Whitted stated that the object "looked like a wingless aircraft...it seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare."

**Date:** 9/30/1948?  
**Locations:** New Mexico; Fargo, North Dakota  
**Description:** Project Sign officer Capt. [Robert R. Sneider](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/49319130/robert-raphael-sneider) has decided that the time has come to climax Project Sign’s task and write the required “Estimate of the Situation.” Every intelligence operation’s task is ultimately to present such a best-guess summary, strongly backed with as much fact as possible. Using the Chiles-Whitted case as the core and collecting around it many cases from the summer of 1947 to September 1948, Sneider composes the document. The most recent case known to have been listed in the document is the September 23 Los Alamos National Laboratory sighting in New Mexico. Two prominent USAF intelligence officers \([Ruppelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FJ.%5FRuppelt) and [Dewey J.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8653239/dewey-j%5F-fournet) [Fournet](https://www.nicap.org/ufochop2.htm) Jr.\) see the document in 1952. “It was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed on legal-sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET.” Ruppelt says the Estimate concludes that the best evidence indicated an extraterrestrial origin for UFOs. Sneider is probably the primary author. [Deyarmond](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ori-ahvZRlU/VWjL8ELOjzI/AAAAAAAALts/kwi03CO17vE/s1600/Deyarmond%2BAlbert%2B7pictures%2B%2528dragged%2529.jpg)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/209268646/alfred-christian-loedding) [Loedding](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/209268646/alfred-christian-loedding)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/209268646/alfred-christian-loedding) and [Truettner](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58335429/lawrence-hess-truettner) almost certainly are part of the writing. [Llewellyn](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/124634808/raymond-anderson-llewellyn) certainly looks in. All these people, as well as higher-ups in [Clingerman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113944251/william-r%5F-clingerman)’s and [McCoy](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2014/10/colonel-howard-mccoy-and-mj-12.html)’s offices, must approve it, at least in some sense. And an Estimate of UFOs as extraterrestrial is no small thing to assent to. The Estimate is probably addressed to Chief of Staff Gen. [Hoyt Vandenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoyt%5FVandenberg), but it really is meant for Director of Intelligence Gen. [Charles Cabell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FP.%5FCabell)[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FP.%5FCabell) It is probably sent near the end of September, just before the [George Gorman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/711216/george-f-gorman) “UFO dogfight” in Fargo, North Dakota, on October 1. It probably lands in [Garrett](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/33467541/george-duncan-garrett)’s Collections office and is hand-carried to Cabell. Cabell may or may not be shocked. With a pro-ETH Wright-Patterson intelligence group on one side, an anti-ETH Pentagon Intelligence Requirements Office on the other, and open-minded collections officers and the powerful Research and Development chief \(Gen. [Donald L. Putt](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/105883/lieutenant-general-donald-leander-putt/)\) in between, Cabell doesn’t want to decide this on his own. He hands the Estimate further upstairs to Vandenberg himself, who rejects it and bats it back to Cabell with a strong sense of disapproval. Ruppelt adds that some months later the Estimate is completely declassified and “all but a few copies” are destroyed.

### <a name="8C7732D7"></a> Event 3811 (8C7732D7)
**Date:** 10/1/1948  
**Location:** Fargo, North Dakota  
**Description:** 8:30 p.m. 2d Lieut. [George F. Gorman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/711216/george-f-gorman) of the North Dakota National Guard, flying an F-51 near Fargo, North Dakota, spots an object traveling east to west. He describes it as a light 6–8 inches in diameter displaying incredible movements. He repeatedly gives chase beginning at 9:07 p.m., but each time is outmaneuvered by the light, which moves up to 600 mph. On his first pass he gets as close as 500 feet from the light at about 5,000 feet altitude. Gorman climbs to 14,000 feet but stalled out, unable to intercept the light, which is at about 16,000 feet. The light makes evasive and aggressive maneuvers, such as seeming to try to ram the F-51. When it drops to 11,000 feet, Gorman attempts to dive at it, but the light pulls up, rises vertically, and disappears at high speed. The light is also seen by airport control tower operators [Lloyd D. Jensen](https://www.johnsoncountychapel.com/obituary/Lloyd-Jensen) and Manuel E. Johnson, as well as others on the ground and pilot [Arthur E. Cannon](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/102783600/arthur-earl-cannon) flying a Piper Cub at 1,600 feet. Jensen watches the dogfight through 6x30 binoculars, the UFO appearing perfectly round with sharp edges and no fuzzy outline. Project Sign personnel arrive within hours and interview the witnesses. Eventually they conclude the object was a balloon, with evasive maneuvers the product of Gorman’s imagination, since ground observers do not see anything comparable. Some ufologists, among them [Aimé Michel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim%C3%A9%5FMichel) and [James E. McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%5FE.%5FMcDonald), have rejected the balloon explanation.

**Date:** 10/1/1948  
**Description:** At 9:00 p.m. an aerial encounter occurred on this day over Fargo, North Dakota between an F-51 fighter plane and a somewhat flattened white circular unidentified object, blinking on and off. The UFO made a head-on approach toward the F-51, then veered off, next made a 180 degree turn, then out climbed the performance aircraft, rising straight up until out of sight. Its close turns were tighter than could be made by the fighter plane. The encounter lasted 27 minutes.

[Oliver “Bud” Hemphill Jr.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36271029/oliver-hemphill) of the 68th Fighter Squadron is flying a Northrup F-61 Black Widow some 50 miles northwest of Fukuoka, Japan, when the crew picks up an object on radar going 200 mph. As he closes to intercept, the object speeds up to 1,200 mph then slows down again. The plane tries closing in six times, but each time the object speeds away. On one pass the crew sees the object’s silhouette, which looks like a “rifle bullet” 20–30 feet long. The object “seems cognizant of the whereabouts of the F-61 at all times.” Radar operator Barton Halter thinks it is a “new type of aircraft.”

### <a name="AB111F8F"></a> Event 3826 (AB111F8F)
**Date:** Late 1948  
**Locations:** Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Alamogordo–White Sands Guided Missile Range, New Mexico; an area in Nevada between Fallon and Eureka; Tonopah–Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range; Pamlico Sound area off the coast of North Carolina  
**Description:** The search for a suitable US location for nuclear testing, codenamed “Project Nutmeg,” commences under the direction of expert meteorologist and Navy Captain Howard B. Hutchinson. The government is looking for a place where nuclear tests would have little impact on the American people or the American economy. Five primary sites are considered: Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Alamogordo–White Sands Guided Missile Range, New Mexico; an area in Nevada between Fallon and Eureka; the Tonopah–Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range \(the site finally chosen in 1950, now part of Nellis Air Force Base\); and the Pamlico Sound area off the coast of North Carolina.

**Date:** 10/15/1948  
**Description:** At 11:05 p.m. U.S. Air Force pilot Halter and radar operator Hemphill in a propeller driven P-61 "Black Widow" night fighter tracked up to six objects on radar over Fusuoka, Japan. The six bogeys were seen on the radar by Hemphill, and his radar picked up the targets five miles ahead of the plane. Only one of the bogeys was seen visually. It was a dull or dark object, shaped like a bullet or dirigible with a flat bottom and with a heel-shaped clipped tail end. Pilot Halter attempted to close on the visual object, but it dove below the F-61, then reappeared, and finally took off with a burst of speed.

It was about three miles away to the northeast at 1,000 feet altitude in a gradual climb traveling at an estimated 600-1,000 mph and heading west towards Moorhead. It made no sound, and was about half the size of a full moon in angular size. When they reached the northern outskirts of Moorhead the object suddenly made a right turn and one second later disappeared by suddenly switching off. The Air Force said they had seen a meteor.

**Description:** A USAF Europe document transmits some information on the Swedish ghost rockets. “They have been reported by so many sources and from such a variety of places that we are convinced that they cannot be disregarded and must be explained on some basis which is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of our present intelligence thinking.” One of the objects was observed crashing into a lake by Swedish Gen. [Helge Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helge%5FJung) and his party. A salvage operation was unsuccessful. USAF officers visit Swedish Air Intelligence officials who have reached the conclusion that “these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on earth.” The document is distributed to the CIA \(which in response to a FOIA request claims no record\), Armament Intelligence Branch, and AMC.

It contains several comments agreeing with Cabell that the UFO phenomenon is not identifiable and that no concrete physical proof exists to identify it. At the same time it drops all sorts of hints, doubtless the same arguments used in the original Estimate, that the objects really are extra- terrestrial whether the Pentagon thinks so or not: It mentions the ETH; it mentions plotting waves against planetary approaches and finding a correlation; it mentions the books of [Charles Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FFort) as indicating that this has been going on for at least a century; it mentions that odd shapes \(like the Chiles-Whitted case\) can fly but require more advanced power plants than we have.

**Date:** 11/30/1948  
**Locations:** Ohio; Wright-Patterson AFB; National Archives  
**Description:** An interim report by Project Sign, one that apparently takes seriously the possibility that UFOs represent interplanetary probes, is accidentally destroyed. USAF Intelligence later requests a replacement copy from TID at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. A recent FOIA to the National Archives answers that such a document would be in Project Blue Book files, but it is not.

**Description:** The revised Project Sign report is issued, Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203-79, “Analysis of Fly- ing Object Incidents in the U.S.” \(AIR 203\) \[Some copies are confusingly dated April 28, 1949.\] This is the cul- mination of Sign’s work since early August, augmented by ONI collaboration over the past two months. UFOs are not extraterrestrial \(the idea is hardly noticed\). UFOs are probably real, but if so, there is a small chance that they are Soviet and therefore dangerous. All in all, the word “Soviet” dominates the commentary.

**Date:** 12/20/1948  
**Locations:** Lt. Col. Doyle Rees; Los Alamos  
**Description:** In a confidential memo to Lt. Col. [Doyle Rees](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43562489/doyle-rees)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43562489/doyle-rees) [LaPaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%5FLaPaz) argues that the green fireball he saw on December 12 was no meteor he has ever studied. He writes that the object moved far too slowly to have been a meteor and left no “trail of sparks or dust cloud” as would be typical of meteors flying at low altitudes. Other anomalous characteristics were the intense lime-green color, low altitude of only 8–10 miles yet exhibiting no sound, flat rather than arced trajectory, and turning on and off like a light switch. The interest in green fireballs inspires the creation of an informal group, the Los Alamos Astrophysical Association, whose members, all scientists and engineers with security clearances, are permitted to examine some classified Project Sign reports. This is essentially the beginning of Project Twinkle.

Skipper\) at an Atomic Energy Security Service post west of Los Alamos, New Mexico, spot a blue-white fireball moving in a nearly flat trajectory. Two objects separate from the main body and trail behind it. Thanks to an independent observation at another site, LaPaz is able to triangulate its flight path as 7–8 miles, west to east toward Los Alamos.

[Truettner](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58335429/lawrence-hess-truettner) makes one last serious attempt at interviewing about nuclear propulsion \(at Oak Ridge, Tennessee\) and is given a negative opinion on UFOs by Col.

Even [Clingerman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113944251/william-r%5F-clingerman) and [McCoy](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2014/10/colonel-howard-mccoy-and-mj-12.html) become less involved, perhaps because they have also heard that their tenures will soon be up and they will be sent to school and then transferred. The only persons left active on the project are two of the lower ranks: Lieut. Howard W. Smith and civilian [George W. Towles](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59257302/george-w%5F-towles)[.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59257302/george-w%5F-towles) Their job is reduced basically to collection and filing. In this condition, or worse, the Air Force commitment to a UFO investigation project will remain until the summer of 1951.

**Date:** 1/27/1949  
**Locations:** Eglin AFB near Valparaiso, Florida; Cortez Road between Bradenton and Cortez, Florida  
**Description:** 10:20–11:20 p.m. Capt. [Eckerman Sannes](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/140394050/eckerman-sannes), acting chief of the Aircraft Branch at Eglin AFB near Valparaiso, Florida, and his wife are driving slowly on Cortez Road between Bradenton and Cortez, Florida, when they observe a “cucumber-shaped” object. The object, seen through binoculars, seems as long as two Pullman cars, with 7 lighted, square windows. It is throwing sparks and approximately 8–10 miles away. In the first sighting at 10:20 p.m., the object approaches from the south going north, moving from an altitude of 8,000 feet in a gradual descent until lost behind trees. In the second sighting at 11:20 p.m., the object is seen in the north, heading south and making a gradual turn to the west. It descends then climbs with a bouncing motion \(up 4,000 feet, down 2,000 feet\) at about 400–500 mph, resulting in an overall climb and loss to view at an altitude of around 40,000 feet. The bouncing appears to start after the final 270° course change to the west.

**Date:** 1/31/1949  
**Locations:** Kirtland AFB in New Mexico; Amarillo; Lamesa, Texas  
**Description:** Kirtland AFB in New Mexico notifies the Pentagon that it will launch an immediate investigation of the green fireballs, noting that “local commanders \[are\] perturbed by implications of phenomena.” [LaPaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%5FLaPaz) speaks to dozens of witnesses of the January 30 fireball and manages a rough triangulation of the fireball’s 143-mile path from Amarillo to Lamesa, Texas. He estimates its speed at 25,000–50,000 mph, with a beginning altitude of 60,000 feet and a final altitude around 40,000 feet. LaPaz accompanies search teams to bring back any fragments. They end up in the area of Lamesa but give up after a few days of fruitless search. He later tells AFOSI agent Paul Ryan that the fireballs are artificial, perhaps radio-controlled missiles directed by enemy agents in the Southwest.

[Howard McCoy](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2014/10/colonel-howard-mccoy-and-mj-12.html) \(chief of the Intelligence Department\). 72 pages are visible in the NICAP copy and 1,537 pages \(some illegible\) are available on the Blue Book microfilm. Its conclusions are based on 273 reports \(243 US and 30 foreign\) and it summarizes the characteristics of four types of UFOs: flying discs, cigar-shaped objects, spherical objects, and balls of light. It acknowledges the possibility that “these aerial objects are visitors from another planet” and refers to commentary in Appendix D by [James Lipp](http://www.astronautix.com/l/lipp.html) of the RAND project. “No definite and conclusive evidence is yet available that would prove or disprove the existence of these unidentified objects as real aircraft of unknown and unconventional configuration. It is unlikely that positive proof of their existence will be obtained without examination of the remains of crashed objects.        Evaluation of reports of unidentified objects is a necessary activity of military intelligence agencies. Such sightings are inevitable, and under wartime conditions rapid and convincing solutions of such occurrences are necessary to maintain morale of military and civilian personnel. In this respect, it is considered that the establishment of procedures and training of personnel is in itself worth the effort expended on this project.” Truettner and Deyarmond, in a between-the-lines rebuke of [Cabell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FP.%5FCabell)’s order not to consider the ETH, recommend that if enough cases are examined and proven to have no security risks, then the project should be terminated. The report is distributed to AMC, USAF Intelligence Directorate, ONR, Cambridge Labs, Air Weather Services, [Hynek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%5FAllen%5FHynek) at Ohio State University, the RAND Project, and the USAF Scientific Advisory Board.

**Date:** 2/16/1949  
**Location:** Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico  
**Description:** A Conference on Aerial Phenomena is held at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico with military representatives [Lincoln LaPaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln%5FLaPaz), [Norris E. Bradbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris%5FBradbury), [Marshall Holloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall%5FHolloway), [Frederick Reines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick%5FReines), and [Edward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FTeller) [Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FTeller) in attendance. Representatives from Project Grudge are noticeably absent. LaPaz tells the attendees that while most meteors are blue-green, the green fireballs are described as pale green or yellow-green. Normal meteors rarely move in long, horizontal paths with nearly constant velocities. He says there are 10 incidents that strongly fit the pattern and 20 others that might. The scientists agree to set up a series of instrument stations to photograph and analyze the fireballs. Teller thinks the fireballs might be electrical-optical phenomena. Navy Commander [Richard S. Mandelkorn](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/133083603/richard-shai-mandelkorn)[,](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/133083603/richard-shai-mandelkorn) who is in attendance, writes in his report that “there is cause for concern of the continued occurrences of unexplainable phenomena of this nature in the vicinity of sensitive installations.”

**Description:** 5:57 p.m. University of New Mexico Professor of Civil Engineering Marvin May sees a brilliant white object in the west at 6° elevation for less than 6 minutes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The object is first round then shifts to an ellipse as it approaches, then it appears to be elongated like a bent pipe with corners, one full moon in length. It makes a slight climbing turn to the north, shifts to peach color as it makes a rapid sharp turning climb to the south, disappearing in cloudless sky by diminishing in size and brightness. At the same time, 100 guards at Sandia Base, New Mexico, including the officer of the guard, see a yellow-orange cigar-shaped object for seven minutes.

The AMC officers retort that the fireballs are not an Army concern. Groseclose and Smith say they are concerned with all anomalous aerial phenomena. Disgusted, Godsoe leaves the room. Groseclose and Smith then turn on LaPaz, criticizing him for only sending AMC raw data and not finished analyses. LaPaz says he is on leave as a volunteer and must go back to the University of New Mexico, unless he sees a contract. However, AMC agrees to set up a network of observation posts with cameras, transits, and trained personnel.

Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FB.%5FMoore) and four Navy Skyhook balloon launch crewmen \(Navy Chief Fire Controlman William Akers, Davidson, Fitzsimmons, Moorman\) see a white, round object, shadowed yellowish on one side, cross the sky from the south to the east, three miles north of Arrey, New Mexico. [Joseph Gordon Vaeth](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138676358/joseph-gordon-vaeth) is present as the Navy representative in charge of ground handling. Moore tracks it for 60 seconds on a theodolite.

**Location:** Pentagon Office of Public Information  
**Description:** A 22-page memorandum for the press \(629-49\) on “Project Saucer” is released by the Pentagon Office of Public Information, scheduled deliberately to coincide with part one of Shalett’s article in the Saturday Evening Post. The writer is unknown, but it is more pro-ETH than the current Project Grudge mentality, listing several solid and dramatic cases. It concludes: “The ‘saucers’ are not a joke. Neither are they a cause for alarm to the population.” The discrepancy between Shalett’s mostly dismissive tone and the positivity of the Project Saucer statement causes Maj. [Donald E. Keyhoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald%5FKeyhoe) to wonder if there is a major disagreement about UFOs within the Air Force.

**Description:** 9:20 p.m. Two Army patrolmen southeast of Killeen Base, Texas, see a blinking violet light no more than 1.5 inches in diameter and only 10–12 feet from them, 6–7 feet above the ground. During the 60-second observation, the light passes through the branches of a tree. At 9:25 p.m., 2 miles away, four Army soldiers see a 4-inch light with a 2–4-inch metallic cone attached to the back. It silently approaches them in a level flight at 60–70 mph. It disappears to the southwest at a distance of 150 feet. At about 9:37 p.m., a 2-inch-wide white light appears 100 feet away to the northwest, flying in a zig-zag fashion in a level path 6 feet above the ground. It vanishes abruptly. A third light shows up at 9:39 p.m. in the west-southwest.

### <a name="A007846D"></a> Event 4108 (A007846D)
**Date:** 4/28/1949  
**Location:** Joint Intelligence Committee  
**Description:** USAF Director of Intelligence [Charles Cabell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FP.%5FCabell) sends a report on “Unidentified Aerial Objects” to the Joint Intelligence Committee. It summarizes the history of Project Sign up to its redesignation as Grudge and adds an appendix on “Unidentified Aerial Objects: Fact and Discussion,” which is basically a short version of the sanitized February 11 Sign report, with some green fireball information added. It recommends sending reports of unidentified “light phenomena” to the scientific community and reports of “atomic powered craft of unusual design” to the AEC. It concludes that “There are numerous reports from reliable and competent observers for which a conclusive explanation has not been made” and that some “involve configurations and described performance which might conceivably represent an advanced aerodynamical development. A few unexplained incidents surpass these limits of credulity. It is unlikely that a foreign power would expose a superior aerial weapon by a prolonged ineffectual penetration of the United States.” This essentially resurrects the ETH as a possibility, without clearly stating it.

**Locations:** Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia; Volga River; Saratov  
**Description:** Soviet test pilot Arkady Ivanovich Apraksin takes a new airplane for a flight at the Kapustin Yar site, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. At its maximum ceiling of 9.3 miles, he encounters a cucumber-shaped object, similar to the one he encountered on June 16, 1948, that directs cones of light at his aircraft from a distance of 6–7 miles. The lights cause his communications equipment to fail and damage part of his plexiglass cockpit canopy that results in a loss of air pressure. He manages to land on the banks of the Volga River 30 miles from Saratov. He wakes up in a hospital in Saratov. He again undergoes intense interrogation, psychotherapy, and medical procedures.

**Description:** Three women \(one a schoolteacher, another a biologist working at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and a third who is the wife of a member of the Security Division, AEC, Oak Ridge\) observe an odd trio of “flying saucers” for about 15 minutes: “It was described as consisting of two identical rectangular-shaped objects which appeared to be coordinated in movement and which moved in wave-like motion. The third object was circular in shape and appeared to be in level flight between and above the two rectangular objects. The rectangular objects appeared to be bright metal on top but dark underneath, while the color of the circular object was the same as that of frosted glass. The ‘flying saucer,’ when last sighted, was in level flight and was flying in a northwesterly direction. The weather was clear with high cumulus clouds. The ‘flying saucer’ flew at speed of from 10 to 15 mph over an area just about the center of Oak Ridge.”

He announces it over the PA system to the crowd of 150–200 observers, including pilots, who watch a metallic disc cross to the southeast with a falling-leaf motion. Estimated altitude is 30,000 feet at 300 mph, with the approximate size of 100 feet. A second object is seen at 10:49 a.m. for 2 minutes. A third sighting takes place at 11:25 a.m. An object approaches from the west at about the same altitude, oscillating at 48 per minute, and disappears into the sun.

**Description:** [Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%5FKaplan) responds to a July 1 letter from Gen. [Charles P. Cabell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%5FP.%5FCabell) inquiring about his April visit to Los Alamos, New Mexico. He explains that he has deliberately waited two months to report because he wanted to have a cooling off period from the deep impression the New Mexico witnesses had on him. Moreover, he wants to see if the green fireballs are still reported \(they are\) before he recommends a full-scale instrumented program. He says that [Norris Bradbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris%5FBradbury)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris%5FBradbury) the Los Alamos lab director, has urged that a classified scientific conference be held to discuss the phenomena. Kaplan suspects that the fireballs are an auroral phenomenon, but concedes that their horizontal motion and southern appearance are “difficult to explain.” He recommends a photographic and spectrographic patrol that would stay on to look out for the fireballs.

### <a name="991C4A7C"></a> Event 4298 (991C4A7C)
**Date:** 8/10/1949  
**Description:** USAF’s AMC issues a final 600-page report, “Unidentified Flying Objects—Project Grudge,” Technical Report 102-AC-49/15-100, or “The Grudge Report,” authored by Lt. Howard W. Smith and [George W. Towles](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59257302/george-w%5F-towles). [Hynek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%5FAllen%5FHynek)’s April analysis is included as an appendix. Based on 237 cases, Hynek finds that 32% can be explained astronomically. Others say 12% are balloons, 33% are other misidentifications, hoaxes, or insufficient information. That leaves 23% \(55\) classed as unknowns. Despite this, witnesses are mostly deluded, hysterical, lying, or crazy, and “further study along present lines would only confirm the findings presented herein.” The report concludes there is little evidence to prove UFOs are real and do not represent a security threat. It recommends that press releases be created to “aid in dispelling public apprehension.” On the other hand, it suggests that military and government agencies interested in “psychological warfare” be informed of the findings. Appendix D is written by USAF Scientific Advisory Board member [George E. Valley](http://news.mit.edu/1999/valley-1020), who writes that extraterrestrial civilizations “might observe that on Earth we now have atomic bombs and are fast developing rockets. In view of the past history of mankind, they should be alarmed. We should, therefore, expect at this time above all to behold such visitations.” Project Grudge enters a period of dormancy until July 1950. The report is classified Secret until August 1, 1952.

**Date:** 9/26/1949  
**Locations:** Lexington, Nebraska; 5 miles southeast of Lexington, Nebraska  
**Description:** 6:30 p.m. [Lester Wolfe](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/79461100/lester-wolfe) and five others 5 miles southeast of Lexington, Nebraska, are threshing wheat when they see three objects coming from the general direction of the sun \(southwest\). As the objects move, they give off a dazzling brilliance. They maintain a level flight with two of the objects changing positions as they fly. The power of the illumination remains constant throughout the incident \(no pulses or flashes\). Once the objects reach a direction northwest of the observers, they make a smooth 90° turn straight upwards and climb rapidly out of sight. Dean Wolfe is a recent graduate of a two-year course in aeronautical design and thinks the objects look like domed discs when viewed face forward, but are more like stubby, wingless, tailless fuselages when seen from the side.

**Date:** 10/14/1949  
**Locations:** San Diego County, California; Point Loma, California; Palomar Gardens Café  
**Description:** 1:15 p.m. [Harley C. Marshall](http://palomarskies.blogspot.com/2009/04/who-are-you-callin-dummy.html)[,](http://palomarskies.blogspot.com/2009/04/who-are-you-callin-dummy.html) manager of public relations at Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, is driving away from the observatory when he sees a perfect “V of V’s” formation of about 16–18 silver objects without tails or wings overhead traveling at high speed to the northwest and emitting a sound like jets. He stops and watches them disappear behind the cloud cover. Returning to the observatory, he phones electrician [Benjamin B. Traxler](https://calisphere.org/item/aa361e48f44cf8ee0f94886f6639c1db/)[,](https://calisphere.org/item/aa361e48f44cf8ee0f94886f6639c1db/) who at 1:20 p.m. sees one dark UFO traveling to the southwest. Marshall checks the Navy Electronics Laboratory Geiger counter on site and sees that the needle has jumped off the scale for several seconds. For the next 10 days, another 21 incidents of off-scale cosmic-ray detector incidents occur at scattered times, fitting a periodic 1.5-hour time schedule, a phenomenon not seen before or after, and unexplainable by equipment failure or radio interference from aircraft. Two representatives of the Office of Naval Research and two from the Naval Electronics Laboratory in Point Loma, California \([Joseph P. Maxfield](http://maxfieldgenealogy.com/maxfieldjs9001.html) and G. L. Bloom\), visit the observatory to investigate the readings, but not before they stop in at Alice Wells’s Palomar Gardens Café on the way in. After [George Adamski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%5FAdamski) claims he has seen increased UFO activity in the area \(including a sighting about the same time as another observation by Traxler on October 21\), they ask him if he would send them any photos he might take with one of his telescopes. He gives them a copy of a telescopic photo he took in February 1949 with his 15-inch reflector. The Naval Electronics Lab later attributes the photo to “electric discharge which frequently occurs in cameras during film pulling in dry or cold climates.” Several Navy aircraft of differing prop and jet types are flown near the observatory using radio, altimeter, and radars on October 21 and November 2 in an unsuccessful effort to trigger the Geiger counter.

### <a name="D62EB202"></a> Event 4382 (D62EB202)
**Date:** 10/23/1949  
**Location:** St. Peter and Paul Church in Norwood, Ohio  
**Description:** 7:15–10:45 p.m. Rev. [Gregory Miller](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5347017/gregory-a-miller) has set up his searchlight once again at St. Peter and Paul Church in Norwood, Ohio. Sgt. Berger turns on the light and picks up a large object in the beam. At about 10:00 p.m., the searchlight picks up two distinct groups of five triangular objects that seem to emerge from the main disc. They descend on the beam then turn out of it. The same performance is repeated 30 minutes later. About 50 persons, including newspaper reporters observe the objects. Miller takes several photographs and asks Sgt. Leo Davidson of the Norwood police department to film the display. He uses three rolls, 25 feet each, and a Hugo-Meyer F-19- 3" camera with telephoto lens. Davidson also takes 10 still photographs of the large disc-shaped object that flies in and out of the searchlight beam, using a Speed-Graphic camera with a 14-inch Wallensach telephoto lens. Two of these are exceptional shots, showing both the parent object and the smaller group. These two pictures are last seen by Time-Life correspondent Harry Mayo, who has prepared a feature story for Time, which was to include them. But Mayo’s story and Miller’s photos were not used in Time or Life and, in spite of requests by Miller, these two photos are never returned.

**Date:** 12/2/1949  
**End date:** 12/3/1949  
**Locations:** Hanford Site plutonium production facility; eastern Washington  
**Description:** The US government releases radioactive fission products at the Hanford Site plutonium production facility in eastern Washington in an operation called Green Run. The radioisotopes are supposed to be detected by US Air Force reconnaissance. Sources cite 5,500–12,000 curies of iodine-131 are released and an even greater amount of xenon-133. The radiation is distributed over 500,000 acres encompassing three small towns and causes the cessation of intentional radioactive releases at Hanford until 1962, when more experiments commence. There are some indications that many other tests are conducted in the 1940s prior to Green Run, although this is a particularly large test. Evidence suggests that filters to remove the iodine are disabled during the test.

**Location:** Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  
**Description:** 5:00 p.m. Mario Restier is returning home from his father’s place in Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when he notices a disc land about 32–50 feet from the road. He hears a voice telling him not to be afraid and asking if he wants to know what it’s all about. Two beings about 5 feet 5 inches emerge from the UFO wearing togas and helmets. Restier asks them if they believe in God, and they answer, “God is one.” Encouraged, he enters the craft where he is offered a trip, put in a tub filled with liquid, and taken on a trip to a city on another world. He is shown a screen that depicts human nature, ambitions, and violence. After about 6 hours, he is returned to the spot where he was abducted. Returning to his father’s house, he finds it is April 14, 1950, and has lost nearly four months of earth time.
